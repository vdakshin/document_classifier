Using Host Profiles in the
vSphere Web Client

1

The Host Profiles feature creates a profile that encapsulates the host configuration and helps to manage the
host configuration, especially in environments where an administrator manages multiple hosts or clusters in
vCenter Server.
Host Profiles provide an automated and centrally-managed mechanism for host configuration and
configuration compliance. Host Profiles can improve efficiency by reducing reliance upon repetitive,
manual tasks. Host Profiles capture the configuration of a pre-configured and validated reference host, store
the configuration as a managed object and use the catalog of parameters contained within to configure
networking, storage, security and other host-level parameters. Host Profiles can be applied to either
individual hosts or to a cluster; applying a Host Profile to a cluster will affect all hosts in the cluster and
result in a consistent configuration across all hosts in that cluster.
Host Profiles can be used to validate the configuration of a host by checking compliance of a host or cluster
against the Host Profile that is associated with that host or cluster.

vSphere Host Profiles

Host Profiles Usage Model in the vSphere Web Client

The Host Profile workflow starts with the concept of a reference host; the reference host serves as the
template from which the Host Profile is extracted. The designation reference host, and the Host Profile
association to that host, persists even after creating the Host Profile. The reference host must be both healthy
and available for subsequent usage of the Host Profile.
Before you begin, ensure that you have an existing vSphere enviroment installation with at least one
properly and completely configured host.
The sequence required to create a Host Profile from a reference host, apply the Host Profile to a host or
cluster and check compliance against the Host Profile is as follows:
1
2
3 Attach other hosts or clusters to the Host Profile.
4

Set up and configure the reference host.
Create a Host Profile from the reference host.

Check the compliance to the Host Profile. If all hosts are compliant with the reference host, they are
correctly configured.

5 Apply (remediate).
Host Profiles is supported only for hosts running VMware vSphere 4.0 or later. This feature is not supported
for VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier hosts. If you have hosts running VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or
earlier, you may attach a Host Profile to these hosts, but remediateion and compliance check will always
fail. Additionally, a host that is running VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier cannot be used as a reference
host.
As a licensed feature of vSphere, Host Profiles are only available when the appropriate licensing is in place.
If you see errors, ensure that you have the appropriate vSphere licensing for your hosts.
If you want the Host Profile to use directory services for authentication, the reference host needs to be
configured to use a directory service. See the vSphere Security documentation.

vSphere Auto Deploy

For hosts provisioned with vSphere Auto Deploy, vSphere Web Client owns the entire host configuration,
which is captured in a Host Profile. In most cases, the Host Profile information is sufficient to store all
configuration information. Sometimes the user is prompted for input when the host provisioned with Auto
Deploy boots. See the vSphere Installation and Setup documentation for more information on Auto Deploy.

Access Host Profiles in the vSphere Web Client

The Host Profiles main view lists all available profiles. Administrators can also use the Host Profiles main
view to perform operations on Host Profiles and configure profiles.

Procedure
1
2

From the vSphere Web Client Home, click Rules and Profiles.
Click Host Profiles.

Create a Host Profile in the vSphere Web Client

You create a new Host Profile by extracting the designated reference host's configuration.

NOTE   You can also extract a host profie by navigating to the specific host or cluster.

Select the host that will act as the reference host and click Next.
The selected host must be a valid host.
Type the name and enter a description for the new profile and click Next.
Review the summary information for the new profile and click Finish.

The new profile appears in the profile list.

Attach Entities to a Host Profile in the vSphere Web Client

After creating a Host Profile from a reference host, you must attach the host or cluster to the Host Profile.

Prerequisites
The Host Profile must already be extracted from a reference host that is healthy and available.

Procedure
1

From the Profile List in the Host Profiles main view, select the Host Profile to be applied to a host or
cluster.

Click the Attach/Detach Hosts and clusters to a host profile icon (
Select the host or cluster from the expanded list and click Attach.
The host or cluster is added to the Attached Entities list.
(Optional) Click Attach All to attach all listed hosts and clusters to the profile.
Click Next.
(Optional) You can update or change the user input parameters for the Host Profiles policies by
customizing the host.
See “Host Profiles and vSphere Auto Deploy in the vSphere Web Client,” on page 16.
Click Finish to complete attaching the host or cluster to the profile.

Detach Entities From a Host Profile

In order to remove the policy-managed configuration from a host or cluster, that host or cluster must be
detached from the Host Profile.
When a Host Profile is attached to a cluster, the host or hosts within that cluster are also attached to the Host
Profile. However, when the Host Profile is detached from the cluster, the association between the host or
host within the cluster and that Host Profile remains.

Procedure
1

From the Profile List in the Host Profiles main view, select the Host Profile to be detached from a host
or cluster.

).

Check Compliance in the vSphere Web Client

You can confirm the compliance of a host or cluster to its attached Host Profile and determine which, if any,
configuration parameters on a host are different from those specified in the Host Profile.

Procedure
1 Navigate to a Host Profile.

The Objects tab lists all Host Profies, the number or hosts attached to that Host Profile, and
summarized results of the last compliance check.

2

Click the Check Host Profile Compliance icon (

).

In the Objects tab, the compliance status is updated as Compliant, Unknown, or Non-compliant.
A non-compliant status indicates a discovered and specific inconsistency between the profile and the host.
To resolve this, you should remediate the host. And unknown status indicates that the compliance of the
host could not be verified; to resolve the issue, remediate the host through the Host Profile.

What to do next
To see more detail on compliance failures, select a Host Profile from the Objects tab for which the last
compliance check produced one or more failures. In order to see specific detail on which parameters differ
between the host that failed compliance and the Host Profile, click on the Monitor tab and select the
Compliance view. Then, expand the object hierarchy and select the failing host. The differing parametersare
displayed in the Compliance window, below the hierarchy.

Remediate a Host in the vSphere Web Client

In the event of a compliance failure, use the Remediate function to apply the Host Profile settings onto the
host. This action changes all Host Profile managed parameters to the values contained in the Host Profile
attached to the host.

Prerequisites
Verify that the profile is attached to the host and the host is in maintenance mode. Since some changes can
impact host operation or resource availability, a host must be in maintenance mode to remediate. This
ensures that no virtual machines are impacted by any host-level parameter changes.

Procedure
1 Navigate to the profile you want to remediate to the host.
2
3

Select the Monitor tab, then click Compliance.
Right-click the host or hosts that you want remediated and select All vCenter Actions > Host Profiles >
Remediate

(Optional) You can update or change the user input parameters for the Host Profiles policies by
customizing the host, and clickNext.
See “Host Profiles and vSphere Auto Deploy in the vSphere Web Client,” on page 16 for more
information about vSphere Auto Deploy.
Review the tasks that are necessary to remediate the Host Profile and click Finish.

The compliance status is updated.

Edit a Host Profile in the vSphere Web Client

You can view and edit Host Profile policies, select a policy to be checked for compliance, and change the
policy name or description.

Procedure
1 Navigate to the Host Profile that you want to edit and click the Manage tab.
2
3
4 Make changes to the profile policies.

Click Edit Host Profile.
(Optional) Change the profile name and description and click Next.

See “Edit a Policy in the vSphere Web Client,” on page 13 for detailed instructions for editing a Host
Profile policy. See “Disable Host Profile Component in the vSphere Web Client,” on page 15 for
detailed instructions on enabling or disabling a policy from compliance check or remediation.
(Optional) Customize the hosts.
Make any changes to the available configuration values for this profile.
Click Finish.

6
The changes are made when the "Update Host Profile" task is completed in the Recent Tasks status. If you
attempt to remediate the profile before the task is complete, the profile configuration does not contain the
change.

Edit a Policy in the vSphere Web Client

A policy describes how a specific configuration setting is applied. You can edit policies belonging to a
specific Host Profile.
When you edit the Host Profile, you can expand the Host Profile's configuration hierarchy to see the sub-
profile components that comprise the Host Profile. These components are categorized by functional group
or resource class to make it easier to find a particular parameter. Each subprofile component contains one or
more attributes and parameters, along with the policies and compliance checks that
Each policy consists of one or more options that contains one or more parameters. Each parameter consists
of a key and a value. The value can be one of a few basic types, for example integer, string, string array, or
integer array.

Security

Enable or disable a ruleset.

Add a user or a user group and set the

n Use the vSphere CLI to configure or modify

the NMP and PSA policies on a reference
host, and then extract the Host Profile from
that host. If you use the Profile Editor to
edit the policies, to avoid compliance
failures, make sure that you understand
interrelationships between the NMP and
PSA policies and the consequences of
changing individual policies. For
information about the NMP and PSA, see
the vSphere Storage documentation.

n Setting values for the Initiator IPv6 Address

and Initiator IPv6 Prefix options in a Host
Profile with independent hardware iSCSI
adapters has no effect on the HBA because
no independent iSCSi HBAs have IPv6
support.

n Add the rules that change device attributes
before extracting the Host Profile from the
reference host. After attaching a host to the
Host Profile, if you edit the profile and
change the device attributes (for example,
mask device paths or adding SATP rules to
mark the device as SSD) you are prompted
to reboot the host to make the changes.
However, after rebooting, compliance
failures occur because the attributes
changed. Because Host Profiles extract
device attributes before rebooting, if any
changes occur after the reboot, it evaluates
and finds those changes, and reports it as
noncompliant.

When DHCPv6 is enabled in the networking
subprofile, manually turn on the corresponding
ruleset in the firewall subprofile.

For the time zone, enter a UTC string. For
example, "America/Los_Angeles" for United
States Pacific time zone.
The default time zone is set to the local time
and location of the vSphere Web Client
machine.
Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP)
correctly. You can configure the NTP settings
on the host's Configuration tab. Click Time
Configuration, and then click Properties at the
top right of the panel.

4 Make changes to the policy.

Disable Host Profile Component in the vSphere Web Client

You can decide whether a Host Profile component is applied or considered during compliance check. This
allows administrators to eliminate non-critical attributes from consideration or ignore values that, while part
of the Host Profile, are likely to vary between hosts.

Procedure
1
2

Edit a Host Profile.
Expand the Host Profile Component hierarchy until you reach the desired component or component
element.

3 Disable the checkbox next to a component to remove it from being applied during remediation or

considered during a profile compliance check.

NOTE   The check box is enabled by default. If you disable the check box so this component or
component element is not checked for compliance or applied during remediation, the other policies that
are enabled will still be applied and checked.

Duplicate a Host Profile in the vSphere Web Client

A Host Profile duplicate is a copy of an existing Host Profile.

Procedure
1 Navigate to the profile that you want to duplicate.

A clone of the profile appears in the Host Profiles list.

Copy Settings from Host in the vSphere Web Client

If the configuration of the reference host changes, you can update the Host Profile so that it matches the
reference host's new configuration.
After you create a Host Profile, you can make incremental updates to the profile. When making changes to a
Host Profile, consider the benefits and limitations of the two methods:
n Make the configuration changes to a host in the vSphere Web Client, and copy that host's settings to the

profile. The settings within the existing profile are updated to match those of the host. This method
allows you to validate the configuration on a single host before rolling it to the other hosts that are
attached to the profile.

n Update the profile directly by editing the Host Profile. This provides the ability to do more

comprehensive and immediate remediation of those changes.

Procedure
1 Navigate to the Host Profile.
2

4

Click Copy Settings from Host.
Select the host from which you want to copy the configuration settings.
Click OK.

Host Profiles and vSphere Auto Deploy in the vSphere Web Client
Host Profiles works with vSphere Auto Deploy to provision physical ESXi hosts have a complete and
expected configuration state for virtual switches, driver settings, boot parameters, and so on.
Because hosts that are providioned with Auto Deploy are considered to be stateless, configuration state
information is not stored on the host. Instead, create a reference host and configure it completely with the
settings you want. Then, create a Host Profile from this reference host. Next, associate the Host Profile with
a new deploy rule using the Auto Deploy rules engine through the PowerCLI. Now, as new hosts are
provisioned through Auto Deploy, they will automatically have the Host Profile applied
Remediation for these hosts is the same as statefully deployed hosts; that is, you must place the host into
maintenance mode and perform the remediation task. The user is prompted to customize the hosts and
enter answers for policies that are specified during Host Profile creation when the Host Profile is applied.

NOTE   If you deploy ESXi through Auto Deploy, configure syslog to store logs on a remote server. See the
instructions to set up Syslog from the Host Profiles interface in the vSphere Installation and Setup
documentation.

For more information, see about setting up an Auto Deploy reference host in the vSphere Auto Deploy
documentation.
