Why Choose VMware® Horizon View™  
over Microsoft RDS 2012? 

Why VMware Horizon View for  
Desktop Virtualization?
VMware® pioneered desktop virtualization in response to 
the unmet needs of the end-user computing market. 
VMware Horizon View™ provides the security, robustness, 
and flexibility required by today’s demanding workforce 
and addresses the challenges of end-user mobility and 
mobile device proliferation.

VMware continues to innovate and augment desktop 
solutions with tighter integration with VMware vSphere®, the 
addition of centralized physical device management with 
VMware Horizon Mirage™, and the introduction of VMware 
Horizon™ Suite, the premier platform for workforce mobility.

Why Choose VMware Horizon View  
over Microsoft VDI?
Horizon View is a proven, enterprise-class VDI solution 
deployed at over 22,000 customers. Horizon View 
deployments range in size to 60,000 or more desktops. In 
addition to performance and scalability, Horizon View 
includes other capabilities that the newly introduced 
Microsoft VDI lacks:

•	Proven,	scalable,	enterprise-class	solution

•	Broad	client	and	operating	system	support	

•	Platform	integration—vSphere

Proven, Scalable, Enterprise-Class Solution
Horizon View offers enterprise-ready capabilities that Microsoft 
VDI does not: 

•	Power	management	for	provisioned	desktops
•	Web-based	management	front	end
•	Cloning	and	disk	space	recovery	
•	Scalable	and	flexible	desktop	templating
•	Support	for	offline	desktops
•	Granular	and	extensive		editing	of	desktop	attributes 	
•	Published	large-scale	reference	architecture	and	success	stories

Broad Client and OS Support
Leveraging an extensive partner ecosystem, VMware offers much 
broader client and OS support than Microsoft. VMware fully 
supports	a	range	of	non-Windows-based	client	endpoints	(e.g.,	
Linux, Mac, Android, and iOS-based certified devices), while 
Microsoft	doesn’t	provide	support	for	non-Windows-based	devices.

Microsoft’s new RemoteFX graphics capabilities are only 
available	on	devices	that	have	either	a	Windows	8	or	Windows	7 	
SP1	Enterprise	license.	Non-Windows	and	non-Enterprise	
licensed devices are not supported by Microsoft.

Platform Integration
Horizon	View	is	tightly	integrated	with	VMware	vSphere—the 	
only platform specifically designed to host virtual desktops. This 
integration offers several unique capabilities:

•	View	Storage	Acceleration	leverages	vSphere	Content-Based 	

Read	Cache	to	provide	up	to	65	percent	reduction	in	peak 	
IOPS,	dramatically	reducing	peak	storage	costs.	

•	View	Composer	Array	Integration	and	Space-Efficient	sparse 	

disk	utilization	provide	efficient	disk	utilization	and	reclamation.

•	Antivirus	offloading	provides	simplified	antivirus	administration,	

higher consolidation ratios, prevention of antivirus storms, and 
improved performance. 

How to Decide?
If you are considering a choice between VMware Horizon View 
and Microsoft VDI, consider these questions: 

1.  Do you need direct support from one vendor for all of your 

devices including non-WIndows devices?

2.	 Do your deployments need to scale to thousands of users?
3. 	 Do your users need desktop access when they travel?
4.	

Is your datacenter virtualized on vSphere? 

An answer of “yes” to any of these questions indicates VMware 
Horizon View is a better solution for you than Microsoft VDI.

VMware Is the Right Choice
Whether	deploying	a	few	virtual	desktops	or	tens	of	thousands, 	
VMware Horizon View provides the enterprise capabilities and 
ease of management that organizations of all sizes require. 
Horizon View, and Horizon Suite, provide a complete end-user 
computing solution for today’s mobile workforce while 
addressing the needs of IT for a secure, centrally managed 
platform. VMware Horizon View is the best choice for desktop 
virtualization. 

Why Choose VMware Horizon View over Microsoft 
for Mixed VDI and Session Deployments? 
Horizon	View	supports	Microsoft	RDS	sessions	using	RDP	to	
provide flexibility for your desktop deployment options. The key 
advantage of using Horizon View over Remote Desktop Session 
Host	services	(RDSH)	is	that	you	get	enterprise-class	VDI	plus	
tight integration with vSphere while still enjoying the flexibility of 
delivering a shared session experience when needed. 

The question of when to use VDI desktops versus shared sessions 
is best answered by considering the use case. If your end users 
are task-based workers and use only a small number of 
applications, Horizon View with shared sessions is a good choice. 
If	your	end	users	require	the	full	desktop	experience	(i.e.,	
administrators  of their own images, native application 
compatibility, and use of desktop applications), View VDI is the 
better choice. Many deployments use a mixture of both. 

Horizon View offers ease of management along with a secure, 
robust architecture, and the ability to offer end users the freedom 
and choice they need to be productive. In comparing VDI and 
sessions, VDI offers the following advantages over sessions: 

•	Eliminates	application-compatibility	issues	
•	User	or	OS	resets	do	not	impact	other	users	(sessions	require	

resetting entire server)

•	Provides	better	native-application	compatibility
•	Eliminates	application-to-application	conflicts	in	a	multi-session	

environment 

•	Applications	do	not	have	to	be	written	with	TS	or	RDSH	in	mind	

(i.e.,	desktop	applications	are	supported)

Figure 2 illustrates the basic architectural differences between 
VDI and shared sessions.

How to Decide?
If you are considering a choice between VDI and RDSH, consider 
the following questions: 

1.	 Do you have users that require constant up time?
2.  Are you concerned about your application licensing 
agreements being valid in a multi-user environment?

3.  Do your users need a full desktop experience, i.e., admins of 

their own machines, unique application requirements, and 
varied and broad USB device support? 

4.  Do you want or need the flexibility to easily migrate users 

between servers?

An answer of “yes” to any of these questions indicates that 
VMware Horizon View is a better solution for your environment 
than RDSH.
