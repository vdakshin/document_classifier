VBLOCK SYSTEMS PROVIDES GORDON 

MEMORIAL HOSPITAL A HEALTHY WAY 

TO DEPLOY EHR, IMPROVE PATIENT 

CARE, AND REDUCE COSTS 

SAVINGS ON SERVICES, SUPPORT, HARDWARE REFRESHES, STAFFING, AND 
MORE ADD UP TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS 

Gordon Memorial Hospital is a small, 25-bed facility located in Gordon, 
Nebraska—population 1,612. The hospital provides inpatient care to residents 
of two Nebraska counties and a portion of South Dakota, as well as outpatient 
services at an attached walk-in clinic and an off-site clinic in nearby Rushville.

When Tyler Fisher joined Gordon Memorial as Chief Information Officer (CIO) 
in 2011, the hospital’s entire IT infrastructure ran off a single server. Even 
with the addition of two other servers, this was not only inadequate for the 
hospital’s existing needs, but it also wouldn’t support sweeping initiatives such 
as electronic health record (EHR), which enables a patient’s medical history to 
follow him or her electronically. 

To capitalize on Federal incentives available to Gordon Memorial as a Critical 
Access Hospital (CAH), help improve patient care, and reduce IT costs, Fisher 
conducted a detailed review of technology solutions and selected MEDITECH 
6.0 EHR software running on a VCE Vblock™ System.

The Challenge 
IT infrastructure was a key focus almost 
from the day Fisher arrived at Gordon 
Memorial. His predecessor had begun 
an upgrade of the hospital’s IT network 
in conjunction with the installation of 
a new telephone system. However, it 
seemed unlikely that the hospital’s 
pre-2005 servers and operating system 
software could improve network 
performance or responsiveness without 
additional enhancements.

With EHR and other planned initiatives 
on the horizon, a major upgrade of the 
hospital’s IT infrastructure was required. 
Fortunately, because of Gordon 
Memorial’s classification as 
 a CAH under 1997 Federal legislation, 
the hospital would be reimbursed  
for a large part of what would 
otherwise have been cost-prohibitive 
technology improvements.

Evaluating EHRs 
After comparing a number of software 
providers’ solutions, Fisher chose 
MEDITECH for the hospital’s EHR. At the 
time, MEDITECH software was certified 
to run on several traditional hardware 
platforms, but was not yet approved 
for use on the advanced converged IT 
infrastructure designed for seamless 
virtualization by VCE.

“I wanted to ensure that if we invested 
considerable funds to upgrade the 
hospital’s IT capabilities, we would  
not only be able to implement a  
state-of-the-art EHR solution, but also 
efficiently run all other applications  
as well,” stated Fisher.

Conveniently, Fisher and the hospital’s 
CEO had recently been introduced 
to the VCE Vblock System when it 
was demonstrated at an executive 
technology briefing at EMC, one 
of VCE’s founders. While Gordon 
Memorial’s CEO worked diligently to 
arrange the financing required for the 
purchase, Fisher worked closely with 
MEDITECH to add Vblock Systems as an 
approved platform for its latest software 
release, MEDITECH 6.0.

The Solution
In late 2012, Gordon Memorial 
purchased a Vblock System 300 EX. 
The pre-designed, pre-integrated 
Vblock System arrived within 
approximately four weeks as  
scheduled and was quickly stood up  
in only a day and a half. Approximately 
one week later, the infrastructure was 
fully configured and ready to run the 
MEDITECH EHR solution. The hospital 
also purchased EMC Data Domain  
and EMC Networker software with  
DD Boost to optimize and accelerate 
 its backup and deduplication  
process—so it could maintain a 
near-real-time copy of its data at its 
Rushville clinic 15 miles away.

Since that time, Fisher and one of his 
three IT team members have been 
working diligently to input the data and 
launch the EHR solution—rolling out 
individual capabilities such as support 
for the nursing staff as the modules 
become available. But don’t think that 
the Vblock System has been sitting idle, 
waiting for EHR to make its debut.

Shortly after the new IT infrastructure 
was installed, Gordon Memorial 
began to move almost all of its 
other applications to the virtualized 
environment running on the Vblock 
System. This included:

•  Domain name server

•  Microsoft Exchange server

•  Microsoft SharePoint server

•  DrFirst e-prescribing

•  Pharmacy med-dispensing server

•  3M coding solution used to translate 

ICD-9 codes for billing

•  Craneware revenue integrity 

solutions for optimum pricing and 
reimbursement

•  Meaningful Use reporting software

•  Time-and-attendance system

•  Informational wiki’s tailored to the 

needs of the clinical team

•  Video desktop infrastructure (VDI)

In short, Gordon Memorial is currently 
running almost the entire hospital 
on 100 virtual machines (VMs) on a 
single Vblock System. This includes 
its EHR and an exciting hospital-wide 
VDI solution supporting approximately 
300 clients for the clinic team and 
administrative staff.

The initial cost of the Vblock System 
hardware for the EHR solution 
was 3% higher than Vendor B and 
approximately 48% higher than  
Vendor C. But by virtually any other 
measure, the Vblock System was 
dramatically superior—delivering a 
better TCO than the other finalists. 
These benefits included:

•  Services—Installation and 

implementation was as little as 10 
percent of the cost of installation of 
the other vendors’ systems

•  Support—Annual costs for single-call 
support from VCE were 35 percent to 
66 percent less

•  Hardware refreshes—Estimated to 

be $152,000 less for Vblock Systems 
over 10 years

•  Point-of-care devices—Upgrade 
of thin clients used in the Vblock 
System-based VDI solution are 
projected to be $24,000 less than 
with traditional workstations

•  Energy savings—Up to $38,000 saved 

over 10 years due to thin clients

•  Staffing—The simplified operations 

and management of Vblock Systems 
will allow the IT team to remain at 4 
FTEs, rather than expanding to 5 FTEs 
as the other solutions will require 

•  Bottom line—With an estimated 

$695,000 in savings beyond the initial 
cost of the Vblock System hardware, 
the hospital’s 10-year TCO is expected 
to be substantially less with VCE

“When I finished my presentation to the 
hospital board, the chairman said that 
it would be foolish not to purchase the 
Vblock System’,” stated Fisher. “That’s 
how clear we felt the decision was.”

Expanding Storage Capacity on the Fly

Although the hospital had purchased 
four separate blades for VDI and 
its other clinical and administrative 
applications (apart from EHR), before 
the EHR was online, all the hospital’s 
applications cohabitated for a time on 
the same host, using the same storage. 
When the EHR solution was added 
to the platform, Gordon Memorial 
suddenly realized it needed to install 
those additional blades and expand 
its storage to maintain the desired 
performance level.

The hospital’s IT team was able to 
upgrade from the existing EMC VNX 
5300 storage array to a VNX 5500 
and install Gordon Memorial’s unused 
blades in one day—moving all of the 
hospital’s VMs while the applications 
remained live.

“The Vblock System made the 
migration so seamless that our staff 
had no idea they were moving from 
one host cluster and set of storage to 
another,” Fisher remarked. “Everything 
happened so quickly that perhaps for 
one mouse click, the system might not 
have responded. But that was it.”

The Results
Fisher and his team chose the Vblock 
System because of its superior 
functionality—the system’s advanced 
converged infrastructure would be  
able to deliver the extraordinary 
efficiency and agility of virtualization 
to enable Gordon Memorial to meet 
patient requirements in today’s 
uncertain healthcare environment.  
In addition, it offered a state-of-the-art 
backup solution essential for protecting 
EHR data.

But to cost-justify the investment and 
help earn the hospital board’s favor, 
Fisher prepared a detailed 10-year total 
cost of ownership (TCO) analysis that 
compared the Vblock System to its two 
closest competitors.

“When I finished my 
presentation to the hospital 
board, the chairman said that 
it would be foolish not to 
purchase the Vblock System. 
That’s how clear we felt the 
decision was.”

Simplified Management and No Downtime

Realistic Revenue Potential

Gordon Memorial also benefits from 
the ease of management of the Vblock 
System, elimination of downtime,  
and highly responsive support.  
VMware vSphere provides essential 
insight into the hospital’s IT capacity  
and performance—making it easy to 
manage and provision compute, network, 
and storage resources and maintain high 
availability and full security.

Fisher said that beyond vSphere, he and 
his staff only need to “touch the Vblock 
System components once a month or so.” 
This results in significant savings in time 
and effort.

Since the Vblock System began running 
most of the hospital’s applications in 
2013, there have been no major issues or 
unexpected downtime and support from 
VCE has been responsive and proactive. 
Gordon Memorial has just one number to 
call, as opposed to calling the six different 
vendors included in some proposals.

“Our interaction with VCE regarding 
support has been great,” Fisher noted. 
“Their customer advocate stays in 
constant touch with us and anticipates 
our needs before they arise.”

Gordon Memorial is also beginning to 
explore the possibility of leveraging 
excessive virtualized capacity to act as  
a service provider for other local medical 
institutions. Even running the hospital’s 
ambitious VDI and EHR solutions, Gordon 
Memorial has a lot of excess CPU, RAM, 
and storage capacity.

Although the hospital is small and 
isolated, it’s a member of the Rural 
Nebraska Healthcare Network. Nine 
hospitals are connected through a 
recently installed, high-speed fiber  
optic network.

“We’re investigating whether other 
hospitals within the network that don’t 
have a virtualized infrastructure might 
be interested in accessing our virtualized 
solutions as a service,” said Fisher.  
“We’ve got the platform to handle it and 
we can easily expand the infrastructure  
if needed. So, I think, thanks to our  
Vblock System, we may be able to 
capitalize on some revenue-generating 
possibilities soon.
