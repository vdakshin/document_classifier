VCE HAS THE LARGEST SHARE OF THE 
INTEGRATED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS MARKET.*

VCE CUSTOMERS KNOW WHY.

“

We virtualized 100% of the company while keeping the 
business running and almost never experienced a service 
disruption. We’ve been able to confine most of our  
upgrades to business hours. With a small IT staff, it’s nice  
to avoid the disruption to people’s lives that occurs in  
handling everything in the evening or on weekends.

“

– Jeremy Lawrence, Director, Information Technology,  
  Eclipse Aerospace, which inherited a dated, fragile  
  system after acquiring the assets of a defunct company

“

By going with Vblock Systems, we finally managed to reverse the ratio of resources spent on 
administration and the development of new opportunities. Moreover, it is the first step towards a 
greater level of transparency everyone is craving. The Vblock System is the best example of how 
technology can enable IT to better help business people, while decreasing the budget.

“

 – George Oprescu, General Manager, Iqon, which implemented an  
  SAP application to centralize management of its global operations
