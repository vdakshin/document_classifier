What’s New in VMware  
vSphere 5.5 Networking

Introduction
With the release of VMware vSphere® 5.5, VMware brings a number of enhancements to the networking 
capabilities in the vSphere platform. These enhancements enable users to manage their virtual networking 
infrastructure with greater efficiency and confidence. The following are the enhancements made in the  
vSphere 5.5 release: 

•	More	hashing	algorithms	for	link	aggregation
•	More	link	aggregation	groups
•	Traffic-filtering	support
•	Differentiated	Service	Code	Point	(DSCP)	marking	support
•	Improved	host-level	packet-capture	tool
•	Improved	single-root	I/O	virtualization	(SR-IOV)	support
•	40GB	network	adapter	support

VMware vSphere Distributed Switch Enhancements
VMware	vSphere®	Distributed	Switch™	is	a	centrally	managed,	data	center–wide	switch	that	provides	advanced	
networking features on the vSphere platform. Having one virtual switch for the entire vSphere environment 
greatly simplifies management. vSphere 5.5 builds on the improvements made in the 5.1 release by enhancing 
the	link	aggregation	control	protocol	(LACP)	support	and	introducing	traffic	filtering	and	DSCP	marking	support.

Link Aggregation Control Protocol
LACP	is	supported	in	vSphere	5.1.	LACP	is	a	standards-based	method	for	controlling	the	bundling	of	several	
physical network links together to form a logical channel, for increased bandwidth and redundancy purposes.

LACP	dynamically	negotiates	link	aggregation	parameters	such	as	hashing	algorithms	and	number	of	uplinks	
across	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	and	physical	access	layer	switches.	If	link	failures	or	cabling	mistakes	occur,	
LACP	automatically	renegotiates	parameters	across	the	two	switches.	This	reduces	the	manual	intervention	
required to debug cabling issues.

The	following	key	enhancements	are	available	in	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	with	vSphere	5.5:

•	Comprehensive load-balancing algorithm support	–	22	new	hashing	algorithm	options	are	available.	For	

example,	source	and	destination	IP	address	and	VLAN	field	can	be	used	as	the	input	for	the	hashing	algorithm.

•	Support for multiple link aggregation groups (LAGs)	–	64	LAGs	per	host	and	64	LAGs	per	VMware	vSphere	

Distributed	Switch	are	supported.

•	Configuration templates	–	Because	LACP	configuration	is	applied	per	host,	it	can	be		time-consuming	for	
large	deployments.	In	this	release,	new	workflows	for	configuring	LACP	across	a	large	number	of	hosts	are	
made available through templates.

Figure	2	shows	a	deployment	in	which	a	vSphere	host	has	four	uplinks,	and	those	uplinks	are	connected	to	the	
two	physical	switches.	LAGs	are	created	by	combining	two	uplinks	on	the	physical	and	virtual	switch.	The	LACP	
configuration	on	the	vSphere	host	is	performed	on	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	and	the	port	groups.

First,	the	LAGs	and	the	associated	uplinks	are	configured	on	vSphere	Distributed	Switch.	Then,	the	port	groups	
are	configured	to	use	those	LAGs.	In	this	example,	the	green	port	group	is	configured	with	LAG1	and	the	yellow	
port	group	is	configured	with	LAG2.	All	the	traffic	from	virtual	machines	connected	to	the	green	port	group	
follow	the	LAG1	path.

Traffic Filtering
Traffic filtering is the ability to filter packets based on the parameters of the packet header. This capability—also 
referred to as access control lists (ACLs)—is	used	to	provide	port-level	security.

vSphere	Distributed	Switch	supports	packet	classification,	based	on	the	following	types	of	qualifiers:

•	MAC	source	address	and	destination	address	qualifiers
•	System	traffic	qualifiers:	VMware	vSphere	vMotion®,	vSphere	management,	vSphere	Fault	Tolerance,	and	so	on	
•	IP	qualifiers:	Protocol	type,	IP	source	address,	IP	destination	address,	and	port	number

After	the	qualifier	is	selected	and	packets	are	classified,	users	have	the	option	to	either	filter	or	tag	those	packets.

After	the	classified	packets	are	selected	for	filtering,	users	have	the	option	to	filter	ingress,	egress,	or	traffic	in	
both	directions.	As	shown	in	Figure	3	the	traffic-filtering	configuration	is	at	the	port-group	level.

Quality of Service Tagging
Two	types	of	quality	of	service	(QoS)	marking	or	tagging	common	in	networking	are	802.1p	Class	of	Service	(CoS)	
applied	on	Ethernet	(Layer	2)	packets,	and	DSCP	applied	on	IP	packets.	The	physical	network	devices	use	these	
tags	to	identify	important	traffic	types	and	provide	QoS	based	on	the	value	of	the	tag.	Because	business-critical	
and	latency-sensitive	applications	are	virtualized	and	run	in	parallel	with	other	applications	on	a	VMware	ESXi™	
host,	it	is	important	to	enable	the	traffic	management	and	tagging	features	on	vSphere	Distributed	Switch.

The	traffic	management	feature	on	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	helps	reserve	bandwidth	for	important	traffic	types.	
The tagging feature enables the external physical network to detect the level of importance of each traffic type. 
It	is	a	best	practice	to	tag	the	traffic	near	the	source	to	help	achieve	end-to-end	QoS.	In	network	congestion	
scenarios,	the	highly	tagged	traffic	doesn’t	get	dropped,	which	provides	the	traffic	type	with	higher	QoS.

VMware	has	supported	802.1p	tagging	on	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	since	vSphere	5.1.	The	802.1p	tag	is	inserted	
in	the	Ethernet	header	before	the	packet	is	sent	out	on	the	physical	network.	In	vSphere	5.5,	the	DSCP	marking	
support	enables	users	to	insert	tags	in	the	IP	header.	IP	header–level	tagging	helps	in	Layer	3	environments,	
where	physical	routers	function	better	with	an	IP	header	tag	than	with	an	Ethernet	header	tag.

After	the	packets	are	classified	based	on	the	qualifiers	described	in	the	“Traffic	Filtering”	section,	users	can	
choose	to	perform	Ethernet	(Layer	2)	or	IP	(Layer	3)	header	level	marking.	The	markings	are	configured	at	 
the port group level.

Troubleshooting and Performance Enhancements
Troubleshooting	any	network	issue	requires	various	sets	of	tools.	In	a	vSphere	environment,	vSphere	Distributed	
Switch	provides	standard	monitoring	and	troubleshooting	tools,	including	NetFlow,	Switched	Port	Analyzer	
(SPAN),	Remote	Switched	Port	Analyzer	(RSPAN),	and	Encapsulated	Remote	Switched	Port	Analyzer	(ERSPAN).	
In	this	release,	an	enhanced	host-level	packet	capture	tool	is	introduced.	

Enhanced Host-Level Packet-Capture Tool
The	packet	capture	tool	is	equivalent	to	the	command-line	tcpdump	tool	available	on	the	Linux	platform.

The following are some of the key capabilities of the packet capture tool:

•	Available	as	part	of	the	vSphere	platform	and	can	be	accessed	through	the	vSphere	host	command	prompt	
•	Can	capture	traffic	on	the	vSphere	standard	switch	and	vSphere	Distributed	Switch
•	Captures	packets	at	the	following	levels:

 –
 –

Uplink
Virtual	switch	port	–	virtual	network	adapter

•	Can	capture	dropped	packets
•	Can	trace	the	path	of	a	packet	with	time	stamp	details

40GB Network Adapter Support
Support	for	40GB	network	adapters	on	the	vSphere	platform	enables	users	to	take	advantage	of	higher	
bandwidth	pipes	to	the	servers.	In	this	release,	the	functionality	is	delivered	via	Mellanox	ConnextX-3	VPI	
adapters configured in Ethernet mode.

Single-Root I/O Virtualization Enhancements
SR-IOV	is	a	standard	that	enables	one	PCI	Express	(PCIe)	adapter	to	be	presented	as	multiple,	separate	logical	
devices	to	virtual	machines.	In	this	release,	the	workflow	of	configuring	the	SR-IOV–enabled	physical	network	
adapters	is	simplified.	Also,	a	new	capability	is	introduced	that	enables	users	to	communicate	the	port	group	
properties	defined	on	the	vSphere	standard	switch	or	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	to	the	virtual	functions.

The	new	control	path	through	the	vSphere	standard	switch	and	vSphere	Distributed	Switch	communicates	the	
port	group	specific	properties	to	the	virtual	functions.	For	example,	if	promiscuous	mode	is	enabled	in	a	port	
group that configuration is then passed to virtual functions, and the virtual machines connected to the port 
group receives traffic from other virtual machines.
