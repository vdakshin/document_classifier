VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODIntroduction

Cyber security is on everybody’s mind these days, nowhere more than in the defense community, where 
IT managers and security officials are subjected to a daily barrage of promotional material from device 
manufacturers and providers of application and device management solutions. As threats increase in number 
and sophistication, security policy becomes ever more important—that’s clear. Yet policy enforcement is 
expensive and time-consuming, and even with appropriate staff and spending decisions, oversight is often 
lax. For instance, a recent NASA audit found that security policies were not implemented on half a dozen 
servers that host critical data and IT assets associated with control of spacecraft, leaving the door wide open 
to intruders.

In the office and in the field, there are always individuals who find strict security measures constraining and 
look for personal shortcuts. There are also sloppy habits, such as failing to remove a smart card when taking a 
break. What’s more, the increasing popularity of BYOD smart phones and tablets—whether managed or not—
can create additional vulnerabilities, especially when they are used to access restricted material. Their very 
size and capabilities make it tempting to cut corners in unauthorized settings. That’s one reason why  
the endpoint is a weak point and perhaps why BYOD is often defined as Bring Your Own Disaster.  
Once sensitive data is stored on any device, rather than simply displayed, a careless person can enable leakage 
between public and private zones or between secret and top-secret data. Even a well-meaning person can 
also be careless enough to lose a device containing sensitive data—a database of social security numbers, 
weapons plans, compromising personal or other sensitive information—at an airport or other public place.  
A malevolent person can do even more harm, of course. The mention of Bradley Manning or Edward Snowden, 
not to mention Stuxnet, should be enough to remind any security official of the wisdom of blocking—rather 
than merely advising against the use of—USB device access to sensitive material.

In an environment where increasing demand for secure access is accompanied by threats of increasing 
number and sophistication, what solutions should agency management and IT security officials consider for 
the near and middle term?

VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODMultiple Physical Desktops for  
Multi-Network Access

Today, a DoD analyst typically requires two or, for top-secret work, three complete workstations, each with an 
isolated physical connection to a public or secret or top-secret network, with appropriate authentication and 
encryption at each level.

VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODThis solution has been in place for many years and has been fairly effective in keeping classified data in 
its proper place while making appropriate access available. In the field, though, it is neither practical nor 
convenient to carry too many dedicated hardware devices, regardless of form factor, to perform essentially 
parallel tasks. The ability to access multiple, secure networks remotely from a single device remains the hope 
and desire of many who travel on assignment. 

Of course, the quest for convenience and timeliness must be balanced by realistic security concerns and 
individual responsibility. For instance, regardless of technical feasibility, it would make no more sense to read 
classified documents in public, whether on an iPad or hardened PC, than to flaunt hardcopy documents in a 
cafe. And, as many people have asked, “How can you trust your iPad once it’s been to Starbucks?” That’s why 
architectures, equipment combinations, and procedures must be vetted. On the other hand, cumbersome 
procedures and delays can prevent critical decisions from being made within a given window of opportunity, 
and a “good enough” on-time decision is better than a perfect one made too late.

Multi-Network Access from a Single Device
The suggestion that an analyst might like to have wireless access to secret documents on a portable device 
is one of the ideas that prompted VMware® to address this question. A viable implementation may not be far 
off, since the technology and ciphers that can enable secure wireless access are available today. However, even 
with the best authentication and encryption available now or on the near-term horizon, endpoint devices such 
as smart phones, tablets, and even traditional laptops, which store data or enable storage devices, increase the 
potential attack surface by exposing data at rest. That’s why device access to the most secure environments 
still needs to be restricted. Agency policies should prevent access to secret networks from public hot spots, 
hotel rooms, or other venues that are clearly vulnerable to attack and should scrutinize device types and form 
factors carefully. 

The best and perhaps most elegant current approach to the hardware device problem is to use a thin client, 
such as a Teradaci PCoIP zero client, instead of the usual Windows PC, in the office and a portable zero client, 
such as a ClearCube PZC, in the field to connect to VMware Horizon View™ desktops on multiple networks. This 
is a No Data at Rest (NDAR) solution that reduces the attack surface at the network and device levels.

Less desirable solutions include the use of repurposed laptops, which proffer initial savings at the price of 
security, and tablets and smart phones, which are convenient but not secure. Recent studies show that 
repurposing hardware seldom produces a net cost reduction because of the continued, often increased, cost 
of administration, maintenance, and upgrades of older equipment. As a rule, every CapEx dollar spent on 
traditional desktop hardware requires three dollars in OpEx. This is not the case with zero clients, which have a 
much longer shelf life and typically require no maintenance. 

W H I T E   P A P E R   /   6

VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODServer, storage, and desktop virtualization and cloud conversion projects are already implemented or in process 
at many government sites, where Horizon View desktops and zero clients offer performance advantages and 
better management solutions as well as cost effectiveness. By centralizing IT management in the datacenter, 
Horizon View and VMware Horizon Workspace™ provide at least one additional layer of protection, reducing 
the attack surface and eliminating the need for additional edge or endpoint management software. Information 
can be displayed on endpoint devices but not stored or replicated. Instead of data files, which are often the 
targets of focused attacks, this solution exposes only key strokes and mouse events from the client and pixel 
data from a server, enclosed in FIPS 140-2 validated encryption packets.

At the discretion of the IT administrator or policy makers, potentially compromising functionality—such as the 
ability to use USB storage devices to copy files or download executables—can be restricted with global or role-
based settings. Even with best-of-breed VDI offerings, however, the most popular endpoint devices may not 
be optimal choices for secret and top-secret deployments, where security has to trump convenience and user 
experience.

Figure 3: Secure Connection over Insecure Network Using Suite B Ciphers

Even with the best current technology and the latest regulations, wireless networks can be used securely only 
under limited circumstances, requiring both vetting and common sense. So, although it is possible to establish 
trusted connections over untrusted networks, agencies and regulators still have to determine exactly what 
these limits should be. The tendency, in 2013 at least, is still to recognize the possibility but to favor security 
over convenience.

VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODAuthentication and Encryption

It is not necessary to review the history of modern encryption from the Enigma machine to RSA to make the 
case that multifactor authentication and sophisticated encryption are important technologies that enhance the 
level of protection wherever they are deployed. Everybody who cares about security should use them. 

Smart Cards and Multifactor Authentication
Although smart cards are not ordinarily compatible with smart phones or tablets, they can be used easily with 
some thin or zero clients and, of course, smart card readers. VMware currently supports Common Access Card 
(CAC), Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) Token, and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smart cards as 
well as a broad range of compatible smart card readers. 

Smart cards offer another layer of authentication and encryption, depending on the type of card and contents 
of the smart card token. There is also a convenience factor. If a site or agency is fitted with zero clients wired to 
appropriate networks, there is no need to carry a laptop or tablet because the smart card can provide access 
to the owner’s Horizon View session (or sessions, if separate devices are connected to different networks) from 
any available zero client device. Although it may not be everybody’s first choice, this is one way to effectively 
circumvent the BYOD problem. IT administration also has the option of allowing wireless access for zero client 
laptops, preferably equipped with smart card readers.

For commercial sites with less stringent security requirements, IT administrators can choose to enable wireless 
access for Horizon View Clients on iOS or Android endpoints. In these cases, proper security policies and 
workforce education can mitigate risk to some degree. 

Using the Right Ciphers
Until now, NSA has allowed only Suite A ciphers to protect secret and top-secret information. Devices and keys 
are tracked closely, and anybody accessing them must undergo a strict background check.

Suite B ciphers are NSA-approved ciphers that rely on the strength of AES 128-256  to allow communication 
between two nodes to pass secret up to top-secret information.  Looking toward the future, some vendors 
already have National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) approval for devices that use Suite B ciphers. 
Again, agencies need to evaluate new devices carefully in the light of new capabilities, such as ciphers, 
and other considerations, such as durability, reliability, and risk of intrusion or data loss if a device is lost or 
captured.

Horizon View Security Gateway
Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Webmail access for Windows 7 has been possible for several years and 
should work from a Horizon View Windows 7 desktop. Precedent has been set, and the solution should be 
viable. Individual commands should seek the appropriate approvals, including Authority to Operate (ATO), 
Certification and Accreditation (C&A), and Certificate of Networthiness (CoN).

VMware Federal Secure Desktop and BYODProduct Differentiation

Desktop products, such as Parallels and VMware Fusion®, are designed for individual users and run a second 
operating system on a single end-user computer. Many people who carry a MacBook Pro also need to run 
Windows 7. These products leverage the power of the personal computer to enable that solution and similar 
ones, but they do not scale up effectively, and they do not provide the enhanced levels of security needed for 
military or other sensitive work.

VMware Horizon Workspace provides secure access to applications hosted behind a corporate or agency 
firewall. These applications can be used with relative safety on iOS and Android devices as well as on 
conventional computing platforms.

VMware Horizon View desktops are designed for large-scale enterprises, private or public. Hosted Horizon View 
desktops leverage the power of the datacenter. With zero-client access and other measures described in this 
paper, they offer a high-security solution for mobile government workers.

Reduced Cost, Improved Mobility

Replacing hardened desktops or laptops is an expensive proposition when scaled out, even if the replacement 
cycle is extended beyond the customary three years. Zero client devices have a much longer life span and 
much lower initial cost in addition to being intrinsically more secure than workstations, laptops, tablets, or 
smart phones. In addition, diskless clients have no state and no operating system in the traditional sense, so 
the devices themselves carry no licensing fees. More important than acquisition and licensing costs, though, 
are device security concerns. When a BYOD laptop, iPad, or BlackBerry is lost, all the data it contains is not 
only lost but compromised. When a zero client is lost, the device has no practical use to a thief or foreign agent 
except as a paperweight, and total loss is limited to the replacement cost of the device. There are no security 
consequences.

Although Horizon View desktops are not cost-free—there are still acquisition and maintenance costs and 
Microsoft license fees—acquisition, maintenance, update, and administration are significantly less expensive 
than they are for dedicated hardware. Perhaps most important, Horizon View desktops accessed from zero 
client devices over a succession of secure gateways, using multifactor authentication and Suite B ciphers, offer 
a viable, affordable, and relatively secure solution to the problem of mobility in an age of increasing risk and 
continual attack.
