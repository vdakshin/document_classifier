VMware vSphere and Virtualizing the
IT Infrastructure

1

VMware vSphere uses virtualization to transform datacenters into scalable, aggregated computing
infrastructures. A virtual infrastructure presents IT organizations with increased flexibility in how they deliver
their services. A virtual infrastructure also serves as the foundation for cloud computing.
Cloud computing is an approach to computing that builds on virtualization's efficient pooling of resources to
create an on-demand, elastic, self-managing virtual infrastructure that can be allocated dynamically as a
service. Virtualization uncouples applications and information from the complexity of the underlying
hardware infrastructure.
Virtualization, in addition to being the underlying technology for cloud computing, enables organizations of
all sizes to make improvements in the areas of flexibility and cost containment. For example, with server
consolidation, one physical server takes on the work of many servers by incorporating multiple servers as
virtual machines. Also, ease of management and effective resource use are products of virtualizing the
datacenter. When you virtualize your datacenter, management of the infrastructure becomes easier and you
use your available infrastructure resources more effectively. Virtualization enables you to create a dynamic
and flexible datacenter, and can reduce operating expenses through automation while also reducing planned
and unplanned downtime.

Aspects of Virtualization

VMware vSphere virtualizes and aggregates the underlying physical hardware resources across multiple
systems and provides pools of virtual resources to the datacenter.
Virtualization is a process that breaks the hard connection between the physical hardware and the operating
system and applications running on it. After being virtualized in a vSphere virtual machine, the operating
system and applications are no longer constrained by the limits imposed by residing on a single physical
machine. Virtual equivalents of physical elements such as switches and storage operate within a virtual
infrastructure that can span the enterprise.

Virtualizing the Computer

The x86 computer hardware is designed to run a single operating system and a single application, leaving most
machines underused. Even with many applications installed, most machines are underused. At the most basic
level, virtualizing lets you run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine, with each virtual
machine sharing the resources of that one physical computer across multiple environments. Different virtual
machines can run different operating systems and multiple applications, in isolation, side-by-side on the same
physical machine.

In addition to virtualizing a single physical computer, you can build an entire virtual infrastructure with
VMware vSphere, scaling across thousands of interconnected physical computers and storage devices. Using
virtualization, you can dynamically move resources and processing and allocate hardware resources. You do
not need to assign servers, storage, or network bandwidth permanently to each application.

A virtual infrastructure consists of the following components:

n

Bare-metal hypervisors to enable full virtualization of each x86 computer.

n Virtual infrastructure services such as resource management to optimize available resources among

virtual machines.

n Automation solutions that provide special capabilities to optimize a particular IT process such as

provisioning or disaster recovery.

Cloud Computing

In cloud computing, providers deliver hosted services on demand over the Internet. Cloud computing is similar
to utilities like electricity and telephony. The user can consume the level of service needed at any time without
being responsible for the production and management of the service.
A virtual infrastructure is the foundation for cloud computing. Cloud computing depends on a scalable and
elastic model for delivering IT services, and the model itself depends on virtualization to be workable. VMware
vSphere provides that virtualization.

Server Consolidation

Server consolidation through virtualization lets you get more out of your existing servers. It also lets you limit
the physical resources that you need to manage, power, store, and buy. You achieve high consolidation ratios
by consolidating existing workloads and leveraging remaining servers for the deployment of new applications
and solutions.

Business Continuity

Virtualization enables IT to reduce or even eliminate planned and unplanned downtimes. For example, with
vSphere you can migrate virtual machines live to another host and perform maintenance on physical servers
anytime, without user or service disruption. Unplanned downtime is reduced by using vSphere features such
as High Availability and Fault Tolerance.
Traditional disaster recovery plans require manual, complex steps to allocate recovery resources, perform bare
metal recovery, recover data, and validate that systems are ready for use. VMware vSphere simplifies this
environment. Hardware configuration, firmware, operating system, and applications become data stored in a
few files on disk. Protecting these files using your backup or replication software means that the entire system
is protected. These files can be recovered to any physical computer without requiring changes because virtual
machines are hardware-independent.

VMware vSphere , a Platform for Virtualization and Cloud Infrastructure

VMware vSphere manages large collections of infrastructure, such as CPUs, storage, and networking, as a
seamless and dynamic operating environment, and also manages the complexity of a datacenter.
The VMware vSphere software stack is composed of the virtualization, management, and interface layers.

Virtualization Layer

The virtualization layer of VMware vSphere includes infrastructure services and application services.
Infrastructure services such as compute, storage, and network services abstract, aggregate, and allocate
hardware or infrastructure resources. Infrastructure services include the following types:

Compute services

Storage services

Network services

Includes the VMware capabilities that abstract away from underlying disparate
server resources. Compute services aggregate these resources across many
discrete servers and assign them to applications.

The set of technologies that enables the most efficient use and management of
storage in virtual environments.

The set of technologies that simplify and enhance networking in virtual
environments.

Application services are the set of services provided to ensure availability, security, and scalability for
applications. Examples include vSphere High Availability and Fault Tolerance.

Management Layer

VMware vCenter Server is the central point for configuring, provisioning, and managing virtualized IT
environments.

Interface Layer

Users can access the VMware vSphere datacenter through GUI clients such as the vSphere Client or the
vSphere Web Client. Additionally, users can access the datacenter through client machines that use command-
line interfaces and SDKs for automated management.

Chapter 1 VMware vSphere and Virtualizing the IT Infrastructure

A feature that provides high availability for virtual machines. If a server fails,
affected virtual machines are restarted on other available servers that have
spare capacity.

Allocates and balances computing capacity dynamically across collections of
hardware resources for virtual machines. This feature includes distributed
power management (DPM) capabilities that enable a datacenter to significantly
reduce its power consumption.

Allocates and balances storage capacity and I/O dynamically across collections
of datastores. This feature includes management capabilities that minimize the
risk of running out of space and the risk of I/O bottlenecks slowing the
performance of virtual machines.

Provides continuous availability by protecting a virtual machine with a copy.
When this feature is enabled for a virtual machine, a secondary copy of the
original, or primary, virtual machine is created. All actions completed on the
primary virtual machine are also applied to the secondary virtual machine. If
the primary virtual machine becomes unavailable, the secondary machine
becomes immediately active.

A virtual switch that can span multiple ESXi hosts, enabling significant
reduction of on-going network maintenance activities and increasing network
capacity. This increased efficiency enables virtual machines to maintain
consistent network configuration as they migrate across multiple hosts.

A feature that simplifies host configuration management through user-defined
configuration policies. The host profile policies capture the blueprint of a
known, validated host configuration and use this configuration to configure
networking, storage, security, and other settings across multiple hosts. The host
profile policies also monitor compliance to standard host configuration settings
across the datacenter. Host profiles reduce the manual steps that are involved
in configuring a host and can help maintain consistency and correctness across
the datacenter.
Host profiles are also a component of vSphere Auto Deploy. The concept of an
autodeployed host means that vCenter Server owns the entire host
configuration and it is captured within a host profile. Certain policies require
user input to provide host-specific values. To support Auto Deploy for host
profiles, an answer file is created that contains the definitions for those policies.

Physical Topology of vSphere Datacenter

A typical VMware vSphere datacenter consists of basic physical building blocks such as x86 virtualization
servers, storage networks and arrays, IP networks, a management server, and desktop clients.
The vSphere datacenter topology includes the following components.

Compute servers

Storage networks and
arrays

IP networks

vCenter Server

Management clients

Industry standard x86 servers that run ESXi on the bare metal. ESXi software
provides resources for and runs the virtual machines. Each computing server
is referred to as a standalone host in the virtual environment. You can group a
number of similarly configured x86 servers with connections to the same
network and storage subsystems to provide an aggregate set of resources in
the virtual environment, called a cluster.

Fibre Channel SAN arrays, iSCSI SAN arrays, and NAS arrays are widely used
storage technologies supported by VMware vSphere to meet different
datacenter storage needs. The storage arrays are connected to and shared
between groups of servers through storage area networks. This arrangement
allows aggregation of the storage resources and provides more flexibility in
provisioning them to virtual machines.

Each compute server can have multiplephysical network adapters to provide
high bandwidth and reliable networking to the entire VMware vSphere
datacenter.

vCenter Server provides a single point of control to the datacenter. It provides
essential datacenter services such as access control, performance monitoring,
and configuration. It unifies the resources from the individual computing
servers to be shared among virtual machines in the entire datacenter. It does
this by managing the assignment of virtual machines to the computing servers
and the assignment of resources to the virtual machines within a given
computing server based on the policies that the system administrator sets.
Computing servers continue to function even in the unlikely event that
vCenter Server becomes unreachable (for example, if the network is severed).
Servers can be managed separately and continue to run the virtual machines
assigned to them based on the resource assignment that was last set. After
connection to vCenter Server is restored, it can manage the datacenter as a
whole again.

VMware vSphere provides several interfaces for datacenter management and
virtual machine access. These interfaces include VMware vSphere Client
(vSphere Client), vSphere Web Client for access through a web browser, or
vSphere Command-Line Interface (vSphere CLI).

Virtual Datacenter Architecture

VMware vSphere virtualizes the entire IT infrastructure including servers, storage, and networks.
VMware vSphere aggregates these resources and presents a uniform set of elements in the virtual environment.
With VMware vSphere, you can manage IT resources like a shared utility and dynamically provision resources
to different business units and projects.

You can use vSphere to view, configure, and manage these key elements. The following is a list of the key
elements:
n Computing and memory resources called hosts, clusters, and resource pools

n

Storage resources called datastores and datastore clusters

n Networking resources called networks
n Virtual machines
A host is the virtual representation of the computing and memory resources of a physical machine running
ESXi. When two or more physical machines are grouped to work and be managed as a whole, the aggregate
computing and memory resources form a cluster. Machines can be dynamically added or removed from a
cluster. Computing and memory resources from hosts and clusters can be finely partitioned into a hierarchy
of resource pools.
Datastores are virtual representations of combinations of underlying physical storage resources in the
datacenter. These physical storage resources can come from the following sources:

n

n

n

Local SCSI, SAS, or SATA disks of the server
Fibre Channel SAN disk arrays
iSCSI SAN disk arrays

n Network Attached Storage (NAS) arrays
A datastore cluster is an aggregation of multiple datastores into a single logical, load-balanced pool.
Networks in the virtual environment connect virtual machines to one another and to the physical network
outside of the virtual datacenter.
Virtual machines can be assigned to a particular host, cluster or resource pool, and a datastore and datastore
cluster when they are created. After they are powered-on, virtual machines consume resources dynamically
as the workload increases or give back resources dynamically as the workload decreases.
Provisioning of virtual machines is much faster and easier than physical machines. New virtual machines can
be created in seconds. When a virtual machine is provisioned, the appropriate operating system and
applications can be installed unaltered on the virtual machine to handle a particular workload as though they
were being installed on a physical machine. A virtual machine can be provisioned with the operating system
and applications installed and configured.
Resources get provisioned to virtual machines based on the policies that are set by the system administrator
who owns the resources. The policies can reserve a set of resources for a particular virtual machine to guarantee
its performance. The policies can also prioritize and set a variable portion of the total resources to each virtual
machine. A virtual machine is prevented from being powered-on and consuming resources if doing so violates
the resource allocation policies. For more information on resource and power management, see the vSphere
Resource Management documentation.

Hosts, Clusters, and Resource Pools

Hosts, clusters, and resource pools provide flexible and dynamic ways to organize the aggregated computing
and memory resources in the virtual environment and link them back to the underlying physical resources.
Because a host represents the aggregate resources of a physical x86 server, if the physical x86 server has four
dual-core CPUs running at 4GHz each and 32GB of system memory, the host has 32GHz of computing power
and 32GB of memory available for running virtual machines that are assigned to it.
A cluster acts and can be managed as a single entity. It represents the aggregate computing and memory
resources of a group of physical x86 servers sharing the same network and storage arrays. For example, if the
group contains eight servers with four dual-core CPUs each running at 4GHz and 32GB of memory, the cluster
has an aggregate 256GHz of computing power and 256GB of memory available for running virtual machines.

Chapter 2 Virtualization Layer: vSphere Datacenter

Resource pools are partitions of computing and memory resources from a single host or a cluster. Resource
pools can be hierarchical and nested. You can partition any resource pool into smaller resource pools to divide
and assign resources to different groups or for different purposes.

Example of Using Resource Pools
Figure 2-2 illustrates the use of resource pools. Three x86 servers with 4GHz computing power and 16GB of
memory each are aggregated to form a cluster of 12GHz computing power and 48GB of memory. The Finance
Department resource pool reserves 8GHz of computing power and 32GB of memory from the cluster. The
remaining 4GHz computing power and 16GB of memory are reserved for the other virtual machine. From the
Finance Department resource pool, the smaller, nested Accounting resource pool reserves 4GHz computing
power and 16GB of memory in the Finance Department resource pool for the virtual machines from the
accounting department. That leaves 4GHz of computing power and 16GB of memory for the virtual machine
called Payroll.

You can dynamically change resource allocation policies. For example, at year end, the workload on
Accounting increases, and which requires an increase in the Accounting resource pool reserve of 4GHz of
power to 6GHz. You can make the change to the resource pool dynamically without shutting down the
associated virtual machines.
When reserved resources are not being used by a resource pool or a virtual machine, the resources can be
shared. In the example, if the 4GHz of resources reserved for the Accounting department are not being used,
the Payroll virtual machine can use those gigahertz during its peak time. When Accounting resource demands
increase, Payroll dynamically returns them. Resources are reserved for different resource pools, but resources
are not wasted if an owner does not use them. This capability helps to maximize resource use while also
ensuring that reservations are met and resource policies enforced.
As demonstrated by the example, resource pools can be nested, organized hierarchically, and dynamically
reconfigured so that the IT environment matches the company organization. Individual business units can
receive dedicated resources while still exploiting from the efficiency of resource pooling.

VMware vSphere Distributed Services

vSphere vMotion, vSphere Storage vMotion, vSphere DRS, vSphere Storage DRS, Storage I/O Control, vSphere
HA, and Fault Tolerance are distributed services that enable efficient and automated resource management
and high availability for virtual machines.

vSphere vMotion
Virtual machines run on and consume resources from ESXi. With vMotion, you can migrate running virtual
machines from one physical server to another without service interruption. The effect is a more efficient
assignment of resources. With vMotion, resources can be dynamically reallocated to virtual machines across
physical servers.

vSphere Storage vMotion
With Storage vMotion, you can migrate virtual machines from one datastore to another datastore without
service interruption. This ability allows administrators, for example, to off-load virtual machines from one
storage array to another to perform maintenance, reconfigure LUNs, resolve space issues, and upgrade VMFS
volumes. Administrators can also use Storage vMotion to optimize the storage environment for improved
performance by seamlessly migrating virtual machine disks.

vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler
vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) helps you manage a cluster of physical hosts as a single
compute resource. You can assign a virtual machine to a cluster and DRS finds an appropriate host on which
to run the virtual machine. DRS places virtual machines so that the load across the cluster is balanced, and
cluster-wide resource allocation policies (for example, reservations, priorities, and limits) are enforced. When
a virtual machine is powered on, DRS performs an initial placement of the virtual machine on a host. As cluster
conditions change (for example, load and available resources), DRS uses vMotion to migrate virtual machines
to other hosts as necessary.

When you add a new physical server to a cluster, DRS enables virtual machines to immediately take advantage
of the new resources because it distributes the running virtual machines.
When distributed power management (DPM) is enabled, the system compares cluster-level and host-level
capacity to the demands of virtual machines running in the cluster. If the resource demands of the running
virtual machines can be met by a subset of hosts in the cluster, DPM migrates the virtual machines to this subset
and powers down the hosts that are not needed. When resource demands increase, DPM powers these hosts
back on and migrates the virtual machines to them. This dynamic cluster right-sizing that DPM performs
reduces the power consumption of the cluster without sacrificing virtual machine performance or availability.
You can configure DRS to perform virtual machine placement, virtual machine migration, and host power
actions, or to provide recommendations that the datacenter administrator can assess and manually act on.

vSphere Storage DRS
Storage DRS helps you manage multiple datastores as a single compute resource, called a datastore cluster. A
datastore cluster is an aggregation of multiple datastores into a single logical, load-balanced pool. You can
treat the datastore cluster as a single flexible storage resource for resource management purposes. In effect, a
datastore cluster is the storage equivalent of an ESXi compute cluster. You can dynamically populate datastore
clusters with datastores of similar characteristics. You can assign a virtual disk to a datastore cluster and Storage
DRS finds an appropriate datastore for it. The load balancer manages initial placement and future migrations
based on workload measurements. Storage space balancing and I/O balancing minimize the risk of running
out of space and the risk of I/O bottlenecks slowing the performance of virtual machines.

Storage I/O Control congestion management allows cluster-wide storage I/O prioritization. You can control
the amount of storage I/O that is allocated to virtual machines during periods of I/O congestion, which ensures
that more important virtual machines are preferred over less important virtual machines for I/O resource
allocation.

vSphere High Availability
With vSphere HA, virtual machines automatically restart on a different physical server in a cluster if a host
fails.
vSphere HA monitors all physical hosts in a cluster and detects host failures. Each physical host maintains a
heartbeat with the other hosts in the cluster. Loss of a heartbeat initiates the process of restarting all affected
virtual machines on other hosts. vSphere HA admission control ensures that if a host fails, sufficient resources
are available in the cluster at all times to restart virtual machines on different physical hosts.

vSphere HA also provides a Virtual Machine Monitoring feature that monitors the status of virtual machines
in a vSphere HA cluster. If a virtual machine does not generate heartbeats within a specified time, Virtual
Machine Monitoring identifies it as having failed and restarts it. If restarts occur, policies can control the
number of restarts. Similarly, you can use the Application Monitoring feature. If the heartbeats for an
application are not received for a specified time, Application Monitoring restarts its virtual machine.

vSphere Fault Tolerance
vSphere Fault Tolerance on the ESXi host platform provides continuous availability by protecting the primary
virtual machine virtual machine with a secondary virtual machine that runs simultaneously on a separate host.
Inputs and events performed on the primary virtual machine are recorded and replayed on the secondary
virtual machine, which ensures that the two remain in an identical state. For example, mouse-clicks and
keystrokes are recorded on the primary virtual machine and replayed on the secondary virtual machine.
Because the secondary virtual machine is running simultaneously with the primary virtual machine, it can
take over at any point without service interruption or loss of data.

Chapter 2 Virtualization Layer: vSphere Datacenter

Network Architecture

VMware vSphere has a set of virtual networking elements that lets you network the virtual machines in the
datacenter like physical machines are networked in a physical environment.
The virtual environment provides networking elements similar to those in the physical environment. They are
virtual network interface cards (virtual NICs), vSphere Distributed Switches (VDS), distributed port groups,
vSphere Standard Switches (VSS), and port groups.
Each virtual machine has one or more virtual NICs. The guest operating system and application programs
communicate with a virtual NIC through either a commonly available device driver or a VMware device driver
optimized for the virtual environment. In either case, communication in the guest operating system occurs just
as it would with a physical device. Outside the virtual machine, the virtual NIC has its own MAC address and
one or more IP addresses. It responds to the standard Ethernet protocol as would a physical NIC. An outside
agent does not detect that it is communicating with a virtual machine.
A virtual switch works like a layer 2 physical switch. With vSphere Standard Switch, each server has its own
virtual switches. With vSphere Distributed Switch, a single virtual switch spans many servers. On one side of
the virtual switch are port groups that connect to virtual machines. On the other side are uplink connections
to physical Ethernet adapters on the servers. Virtual machines connect to the physical environment through
the physical Ethernet adapters that are connected to the virtual switch uplinks.
A virtual switch can connect its uplinks to more than one physical Ethernet adapter to enable NIC teaming.
With NIC teaming, two or more physical adapters can be used to share the traffic load or provide passive
failover if a physical adapter hardware fails or a network outage occurs.
A port group is a unique concept in the virtual environment. A port group is a mechanism for setting policies
that govern the network connected to it. For VDS, the groups are called distributed port groups. A virtual
switch can have multiple port groups. Instead of connecting to a particular port on the virtual switch, a virtual
machine connects its virtual NIC to a port group. Virtual machines that connect to the same port group belong
to the same network inside the virtual environment even if they are on different physical servers.
You can configure port groups to enforce policies that provide enhanced networking security, network
segmentation, better performance, high availability, and traffic management.

Networking with vSphere Distributed Switches

A vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) functions as a single virtual switch across all associated hosts. This ability
allows virtual machines to maintain consistent network configuration as they migrate across multiple hosts.
Each VDS is a network hub that virtual machines can use. A VDS can route traffic internally between virtual
machines or link to an external network by connecting to physical Ethernet adapters. Each VDS can also have
one or more distributed port groups assigned to it. Distributed port groups aggregate multiple ports under a
common configuration and provide a stable anchor point for virtual machines connecting to labeled networks.

Network resource pools determine the priority that different network traffic types are given on a VDS. When
network resource management is enabled, VDS traffic is divided into the following network resource pools:
FT traffic, iSCSI traffic, vMotion traffic, management traffic, NFS traffic, and virtual machine traffic. You can
control the priority for the traffic from each of these network resource pools by setting the physical adapter
shares and host limits for each network resource pool.
The VMware virtual switching layer provides a set of features similar to traditional physical switches, like
VLANs, traffic shaping, and monitoring.

Networking with vSphere Standard Switches

With vSphere Standard Switches, each server has its own virtual switch: VSSs handle network traffic at the
host level in a vSphere environment. A VSS can route traffic internally between virtual machines and link to
external networks.

VMware vShield and Network Security

VMware vShield is a suite of security virtual appliances that are built to work with vSphere, protecting
virtualized datacenters from attacks and misuse.
VMware vShield is not a component of vSphere, but as a companion to vSphere it provides security for
applications and data in the cloud.
The vShield suite includes vShield Zones, vShield Edge, vShield App, and vShield Endpoint.

n

n

n

n

vShield Zones provides firewall protection for traffic between virtual machines. For each Zones Firewall
rule, you can specify the source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and service.
vShield Edge provides network edge security and gateway services to isolate the virtual machines in a
port group, distributed port group, or Cisco Nexus 1000V. vShield Edge connects isolated, stub networks
to shared, uplink networks by providing common gateway services such as DHCP, VPN, NAT, and load
balancing. Common deployments of vShield Edge include in the DMZ, VPN extranets, and multitenant
cloud environments where vShield Edge provides perimeter security for virtual datacenters (VDCs).
vShield App is an interior, virtual-NIC-level firewall that allows you to create access control policies
regardless of network topology. vShield App monitors all traffic in and out of an ESXi host, including
between virtual machines in the same port group. vShield App includes traffic analysis and container-
based policy creation.
vShield Endpoint delivers an introspection-based antivirus solution. vShield Endpoint uses the hypervisor
to scan guest virtual machines from the outside without an agent. vShield Endpoint avoids resource
bottlenecks while optimizing memory use.

See the vShield Administration Guide.

Storage Architecture

The VMware vSphere storage architecture consists of layers of abstraction that hide the differences and manage
the complexity among physical storage subsystems.

NAS

To the applications and guest operating systems inside each virtual machine, the storage subsystem appears
as a virtual SCSI controller connected to one or more virtual SCSI disks. These controllers are the only types
of SCSI controllers that a virtual machine can see and access. These controllers include BusLogic Parallel, LSI
Logic Parallel, LSI Logic SAS, and VMware Paravirtual.
The virtual SCSI disks are provisioned from datastore elements in the datacenter. A datastore is like a storage
appliance that delivers storage space for virtual machines across multiple physical hosts. Multiple datastores
can be aggregated into a single logical, load-balanced pool called a datastore cluster.
The datastore abstraction is a model that assigns storage space to virtual machines while insulating the guest
from the complexity of the underlying physical storage technology. The guest virtual machine is not exposed
to Fibre Channel SAN, iSCSI SAN, direct attached storage, and NAS.
Each datastore is a physical VMFS volume on a storage device. NAS datastores are an NFS volume with VMFS
characteristics. Datastores can span multiple physical storage subsystems. A single VMFS volume can contain
one or more LUNs from a local SCSI disk array on a physical host, a Fibre Channel SAN disk farm, or iSCSI
SAN disk farm. New LUNs added to any of the physical storage subsystems are detected and made available
to all existing or new datastores. Storage capacity on a previously created datastore can be extended without
powering down physical hosts or storage subsystems. If any of the LUNs within a VMFS volume fails or
becomes unavailable, only virtual machines that use that LUN are affected. An exception is the LUN that has
the first extent of the spanned volume. All other virtual machines with virtual disks residing in other LUNs
continue to function as normal.

26 

 VMware, Inc.

Chapter 2 Virtualization Layer: vSphere Datacenter

Each virtual machine is stored as a set of files in a directory in the datastore. The disk storage associated with
each virtual guest is a set of files within the guest's directory. You can operate on the guest disk storage as an
ordinary file. The disk storage can be copied, moved, or backed up. New virtual disks can be added to a virtual
machine without powering it down. In that case, a virtual disk file (.vmdk) is created in VMFS to provide new
storage for the added virtual disk or an existing virtual disk file is associated with a virtual machine.
VMFS is a clustered file system that leverages shared storage to allow multiple physical hosts to read and write
to the same storage simultaneously. VMFS provides on-disk locking to ensure that the same virtual machine
is not powered on by multiple servers at the same time. If a physical host fails, the on-disk lock for each virtual
machine is released so that virtual machines can be restarted on other physical hosts.
VMFS also features failure consistency and recovery mechanisms, such as distributed journaling, a failure-
consistent virtual machine I/O path, and virtual machine state snapshots. These mechanisms can aid quick
identification of the cause and recovery from virtual machine, physical host, and storage subsystem failures.
VMFS also supports raw device mapping (RDM). RDM provides a mechanism for a virtual machine to have
direct access to a LUN on the physical storage subsystem (Fibre Channel or iSCSI only). RDM supports two
typical types of applications:

n

SAN snapshot or other layered applications that run in the virtual machines. RDM better enables scalable
backup offloading systems using features inherent to the SAN.

n Microsoft Clustering Services (MSCS) spanning physical hosts and using virtual-to-virtual clusters as well
as physical-to-virtual clusters. Cluster data and quorum disks must be configured as RDMs rather than
files on a shared VMFS.

For more information on storage, see the vSphere Storage documentation.

vCenter Server Core Services

Core Services are basic management services for a virtual datacenter.
Core Services include the following services:

Virtual machine
provisioning

Host and VM
configuration

Resources and virtual
machine inventory
management

Statistics and logging

Alarms and event
management

Task scheduler

vApp

Guides and automates the provisioning of virtual machines and their
resources.

Allows the configuration of hosts and virtual machines.

Organizes virtual machines and resources in the virtual environment and
facilitates their management.

Logs and reports on the performance and resource use statistics of datacenter
elements, such as virtual machines, hosts, storage, and clusters.

Tracks and warns users on potential resource overuse or event conditions. You
can set alarms to trigger on events and notify when critical error conditions
occur. Alarms are triggered only when they satisfy certain time conditions to
minimize the number of false triggers.

Schedules actions such as vMotion to occur at a given time.

A vApp has the same basic operation as a virtual machine, but can contain
multiple virtual machines or appliances. With vApps, you can perform
operations on multitier applications as separate entities (for example, clone,
power on and off, and monitor). vApps package and manage those
applications.

Multiple vCenter Server systems can be combined into a single connected group. When a vCenter Server system
is part of a connected group, you can view and manage the inventories of all vCenter Server systems in that
group.

vCenter Server Plug-Ins

vCenter Server plug-ins extend the capabilities of vCenter Server by providing more features and functions.
Some plug-ins are installed as part of the base vCenter Server product.

vCenter Storage
Monitoring

vCenter Hardware
Status

Allows you to review information on storage usage and to visually map
relationships between all storage entities available in vCenter Server.

Uses CIM monitoring to display the hardware status of hosts that
vCenter Server manages.

vCenter Service Status

Displays the status of vCenter services.

VMware, Inc.

VMware vSphere Basics

Some plug-ins are packaged separately from the base product and require separate installation. You can update
plug-ins and the base product independently of each other. VMware modules include:

vSphere Update
Manager (VUM)

vShield Zones

vCenter Orchestrator

Data Recovery

Enables administrators to apply updates and patches across ESXi hosts and all
managed virtual machines. Administrators can create user-defined security
baselines that represent a set of security standards. Security administrators can
compare hosts and virtual machines against these baselines to identify and
remediate systems that are not in compliance.

An application-aware firewall built for vCenter Server integration. vShield
Zones inspects client-server communications and communications between
virtual machines to provide detailed traffic analytics and application-aware
firewall partitioning. vShield Zones is a critical security component for
protecting virtualized datacenters from network-based attacks and misuse.

A workflow engine that enables you to create and run automated workflows
in your vSphere environment. vCenter Orchestrator coordinates workflow
tasks across multiple VMware products and third-party management and
administration solutions through its open plug-in architecture. vCenter
Orchestrator provides a library of workflows that are extensible. You can use
any operation available in the vCenter Server API to customize vCenter
Orchestrator workflows.

A disk-based backup and recovery solution that provides complete data
protection for virtual machines. Data Recovery is fully integrated with
vCenter Server to enable centralized and efficient management of backup jobs
and includes data deduplication to minimize disk usage.

vCenter Server Interfaces

vCenter Server interfaces integrate vCenter Server with third party products and applications.
vCenter Server has the following key interfaces:

ESXi server
management

Interfaces with the vCenter Server agent to manage each physical server in the
datacenter.

VMware vSphere API

Interfaces with VMware management clients and third-party solutions.

The vSphere Client uses the VMware API to access vCenter Server. After the user is authenticated, a session
starts in vCenter Server, and the user sees the resources and virtual machines that are assigned to the user. For
virtual machine console access, the vSphere Client first uses the VMware API to obtain the virtual machine
location from vCenter Server. The vSphere Client then connects to the appropriate host and provides access
to the virtual machine console.
Users can use the vSphere Web Client to access vCenter Server through a Web browser. The
vSphere Web Client uses the VMware API to mediate the communication between the browser and the
vCenter Server.

Using the vSphere Client

The vSphere Client is a downloadable interface for administering vCenter Server and ESXi.
The vSphere Client user interface is configured based on the server to which it is connected:
n When the server is a vCenter Server system, the vSphere Client displays all the options available to the

vSphere environment, according to the licensing configuration and the user permissions.

n When the server is an ESXi host, the vSphere Client displays only the options appropriate to single host

management.

You perform many management tasks from the Inventory view, which consists of a single window containing
a menu bar, a navigation bar, a toolbar, a status bar, a panel section, and pop-up menus.

First Time Use
The vSphere Client includes embedded assistance that guides users who are new to virtualization concepts
through the steps to set up their virtual infrastructure. This embedded assistance is in-line content presented
in the vSphere Client GUI and an online tutorial. You can turn off the assistance for experienced users. You
can turn on assistance when new users are introduced to the system.

Using the vSphere Web Client

The vSphere Web Client is a browser-based interface for configuring and administering virtual machines.
When you first log in to the vSphere Web Client, a home page appears with an object navigator pane that you
can use to browse for inventory objects. The home page also contains a search box that you can use to run a
global search across all applications and objects, a central pane that contains information about a selected object,
and a side panel that contains panes for tasks, events, and so on.
You can return to partially finished work by using the Work in Progress pane. In the My Recent Tasks pane,
you can see completed tasks, failed tasks, and tasks that are currently running.

SDKs and Command-Line Interfaces

VMware provides features and tools for automating administration tasks.
vSphere includes CLI commands for provisioning, managing, and monitoring hosts and virtual machines.
vSphere SDKs provide standard interfaces for VMware and third-party solutions to access vSphere.

vSphere PowerCLI

vSphere SDK for Perl

vSphere CLI (vCLI)

vSphere SDK for .NET

vSphere Web Services
SDK

A command-line scripting tool built on Windows PowerShell that provides
cmdlets for managing and automating vSphere.
vSphere PowerCLI provides C# and PowerShell interfaces to VMware
vSphere APIs. It includes a number of cmdlets that you can use to perform
administration tasks on VMware vSphere components.
Microsoft PowerShell uses the .NET object model and provides administrators
with management and automation capabilities.

A client-side Perl framework that provides an interface to the vSphere API.
Administrators and developers who are familiar with Perl can use the
vSphere SDK for Perl to automate administrative, provisioning, and
monitoring tasks in the vSphere environment. The vSphere SDK for Perl
includes utility applications.

You can use the vSphere CLI command set to run common administration
commands against VMware ESXi systems from any machine with network
access to those systems. You can run most vSphere CLI commands against a
vCenter Server system and target any ESXi system that the vCenter Server
system manages. Most administrators run scripts to perform the same task
repeatedly or to perform a task on multiple hosts.
vSphere CLI commands run on top of the vSphere SDK for Perl. vSphere CLI
is supported on Linux and Windows platforms.

A client-side framework from VMware that simplifies the programming effort
associated with the vSphere API and server-side object model. It is a part of
VMware vSphere PowerCLI, which provides C# and PowerShell interfaces to
vSphere APIs. Using vSphere SDK for .NET you can create, customize, or
manage vSphere inventory objects using vSphere APIs calls.

Includes all the components necessary to work with the VMware vSphere API,
including WSDL files, sample code, and libraries. The vSphere Web Services
SDK facilitates development of client applications that target the VMware
vSphere API. With the vSphere Web Services SDK, developers can create client
applications to manage, monitor, and maintain VMware vSphere components,
as deployed on ESXi and VMware vCenter Server systems.
