VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

Chapter 2 

Overview 

VMware Datacenter and Cloud Management 
In the cloud era, intelligent virtual infrastructure provides the foundation for faster, more agile and 
accelerated delivery of IT services and business applications. However, within virtual and cloud 
environments, the boundaries between operations and infrastructure management have blurred. 
As a result, managing these new environments using tools designed for physical environments 
creates operational and business problems—blocking the path to flexible, service-oriented cloud 
infrastructure. 

Datacenter and Cloud Management with EMC and 
VMware 
VMware’s approach to enterprise management is based on Integrated and Converged 
management. 

Integrated Management 
Performance issues can originate from any component, virtual machine (VM), physical host or 
cluster. What’s more, the rate of change of workloads has outstripped the capabilities of 
traditional management approaches. This requires management capabilities be tightly integrated 
with the virtualization and cloud platforms themselves. 

Converged Management 
Workload interdependence in virtual and cloud environments stymies the ability of specialized 
teams to address performance, capacity and configuration issues in isolation. Highly virtualized 
and cloud environments require integration of management disciplines and metrics for a holistic 
view of the health of virtual and physical infrastructures, and the tools to maintain it. 

In operations, the disciplines of performance, capacity and configuration management are 
converging, necessitating greater collaboration between traditionally siloed IT teams. VMware 
facilitates this collaboration, for example, by providing a single dashboard that can be used by 
both VI and operations administrators alike to look at health, risk, and efficiency across the entire 
IT environment. When deployed as part of the EMC VSPEX validated architecture, the VMware 
management tools provide a significantly lower operational expense as well as a faster problem 
resolution time. 

Managing the Software-Defined Datacenter 
Interdependent, dynamic virtual and cloud infrastructures exceed the capabilities—and outstrip 
the speed—of traditional management processes and tools designed to manage physical IT 
assets. 

Virtual and cloud infrastructures differ from the traditional physical architectures that preceded 
them in important ways. Traditional, siloed environments are built on tightly coupled applications 
and infrastructure dedicated to certain components and application tiers. The resulting rigid

vertical stack offers limited flexibility and agility, and requires a complex stack of tools and equally 
complex set of processes to manage it. 

In contrast, highly virtualized and cloud abstracted resources, have shared capacity and fluid 
configurations that characterize their environments. Tools and processes designed for traditional 
architectures have difficulty managing this highly dynamic, constantly changing and 
interdependent environment. Virtual and cloud computing requires organizations to embrace a 
new management approach—one that is as agile, flexible and dynamic as their new IT 
infrastructure.

management. Users can present a large amount of capacity to a host and then consume space 
only as needed from a shared pool, reducing initial over-allocation of storage capacity. Virtual 
Provisioning can reduce labor costs by simplifying data layout and reducing the steps required to 
accommodate capacity growth. 

Fully Automated Storage Tiering (FAST) 
EMC Fully Automated Storage Provisioning for Virtual Pools (FAST™ VP) for VNX optimizes 
efficiency across all drive types in the array to improve system performance while reducing cost. 
FAST VP dynamically allocates workloads based on the configured service level and moves 
workloads without disruption across drive types, optimizing overall system performance. FAST 
VP moves the most active parts of the workload to high-performance flash disks and the least 
frequently accessed data to lower-cost drives, leveraging the best performance and cost 
characteristics of the different drive types.

Chapter 3 

Overview: VMware vCenter Operations Manager 
Advanced¹ Architecture 

Function in Overall Architecture 
The vCenter Operations Management platform requires integrations to properly operate and 
provide business value. The vApp (Virtual Appliance) version of vCenter Operations Manager 
requires a connection to a VMware vCenter Server. During the initial installation, connection to a 
vCenter Server must be established to provide vCenter Operations Manager as the first 
integration point. This provides vCenter Operations Manager with the necessary metric and event 
data that vCenter Server collects and produces natively.  

The connections from vCenter Server to vCenter Operations Manager provide information on the 
status of all the VMs and the supporting vSphere environment being managed. This status 
information is derived from the metrics relating to the virtual hardware that the VMs use, as well 
as the metrics relating to the supporting VMware ESXi™ host hardware. Additionally, resource 
status is also established using vCenter Server event-related information for the Virtual Machines 
and ESXi hosts. See Figure 1.

VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

vCenter Operations Manager is a vApp that is imported and deployed with a vCenter Server. 

This vApp, which has the same basic operation as a virtual machine, actually contains two virtual 
machines. These virtual machines are configured in a vApp form to provide ease of configuration 
and proper data security.  

Distribution Formats 
The vApp is distributed as an Open Virtualization Format (OVF) file. The vSphere C# Client or 
vSphere Web Client provides an import vApp workflow that guides the deployment of the vApps 
in OVF format. 

The vCenter Operations Manager vApp is managed using the Administration Portal, which is a 
web console for configuration and management tasks. 

vCenter Operations Manager Components 
vCenter Operations Manager architecture consists of two VMs. Figure 2 illustrates the vCenter 
Operations Manager key components of the vApp Architecture. 

Figure 2.  vCenter Operations Manager – vApp architecture 

vApp Components 
UI VM 

The UI VM allows access to the results of the analytics in the form of badges and scores using 
the Web-based application. It also allows access to the Administration Portal in order to perform 
management tasks. The components in UI VM are described as follows:

vSphere UI Web Application 

Custom Web Application 

 

 

Administration Web Application   

The vCenter Operations Manager vSphere® UI provides 
summary and deeper views into the vSphere 
environment for VI Admin and Infrastructure Teams. 

The vCenter Operations Manager Custom application 
provides a customizable Web-based user interface. It is 
available using the Advanced, Enterprise, or Enterprise 
Plus license editions and provides a view into the entire 
enterprise for the Operations Teams. 

The vCenter Operations Manager Administration Portal 
provides a user interface for vCenter Operations 
Manager maintenance and management tasks. 

Analytics VM 
The Analytics VM is responsible for collecting data from vCenter Server, VMware Hyperic, 
VMware vCloud® Application Director™ and other VMware or third-party data sources. The data 
collected includes metrics, topology, and change events. Raw time-series metric data is stored in 
its scalable File System Database (FSDB). The components in Analytics VM are described as 
follows: 

Capacity and Performance Analytics 

Capacity Collector 

File System Database 

PostgreSQL© DB 

 

 

 

 

 

Checks the incoming metrics for abnormalities in 
real time, updates health scores, and generates 
alerts when necessary. 

Collects metrics and computes derived metrics. 

Stores the collected metrics statistics. 

 

Stores all other data collected, including objects, 
relationships, events, dynamic thresholds, and 
alerts. 

Optimizing vCenter Operations Manager vCenter 
Data Collection 
vCenter Operations Manager allows the user to adjust the amount of metrics collected from the 
registered vCenter servers. Metric profile collection adjustments improve the performance of the 
analytics calculation process and scale of the vApp collection. Metric profile collection is a single 
setting that applies to all vCenter servers attached to the vApp system.

VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

To adjust the metric profile collection for the system, access the vCenter Operations admin portal 
page. The main vCenter registration section contains the vCenter server metric profile. This 
setting can be changed at any time and does not require a system restart or deployment changes 
for the modification to take effect.  

The default profile in vCenter Operations Manager upon initial deployment is the Balanced 
Profile. This is also the new recommended setting for optimal performance of the system and 
data collection process. If all metrics are needed in an environment, the user can switch to the 
Full Profile. The following describes the difference between these two profiles: 

  Balanced Profile – Metric collection count is cut almost in half vs. the full metric profile. 

  Full Profile – The full metric profile contains all of the metrics possible to collect from the 

vSphere environment. 

Modifying Data Retention and Custom Parameters 
In certain situations, specifically with large vCenter Operations Manager deployments, it is 
recommended that the user adjust certain values to improve the performance and data collection 
of the vApp. These scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:  

  High-turnover virtual machine environment such as a View/VDI environment 

 

  Low disk space or limited storage access due to approvals or expected use cases of the 

system 
 

  Specific business use case requirements that only require specific data retention, either 

more or less than the default values 
 

  Deletion scheduling of resources is higher than a normal environment  

 

  Multi-tenant environment with self-service portals with high deletion of resources/objects  

 

The advanced properties file contains further settings for the analytics process and other system 
variables for specific operations. The variables in the following section can be adjusted as needed 
in the environment depending on customer requirements. 

Note: Location = /usr/lib/vmwarevcops/user/conf/analytics/advanced.properties 

After each change, the user must restart the analytics service for changes to take effect. To 
restart, go to the Analytics VM and access the console session by SSH or direct console mode 
and typing: service vcops restart analytics. 

Adjusting the Data Cleaner Execution frequency and FSDB Data Retention 

This variable adjusts the amount of data to store for resources. By default, vSphere data is 
retained for 180 days out of the box. To change this default to a longer or shorter duration, simply 
enter the amount of days to retain the data. The example below shows a change from the default 
value of 180 days to a shorter duration of 90 days.  

#Old Data Cleaner Execution frequency. Default is 0(Off) days 

oldDataCleanerExecutionFrequency=1

#old date range for FSDB. Default is 180 days 

oldDataCleanerDateRange=90 

Adjusting the Data Cleaner for alerts and alarms 

By default vCenter Operations retains alerts and alarms. The user can change this value to a 
specified date range. Shortening the date range helps improve the performance of the database 
table that contains all of the alarms and alerts. 

# old data cleaner range for alerts and alarms 

oldAlertsCleanerDateRange=14 

Enable the new Combined DT Plug-in 

vCenter Operations Manager includes a new dynamic threshold calculation plug-in that contains 
an enhanced algorithm that improves DT calculations. This algorithm is not enabled by default on 
new installations because it is a new feature typically used for large installations. Change the 
value from false to true, as shown in the example below, to enable this feature. 

# Enable the Combined DT Plugin which implements the new algorithm 

useCombinedDTPlugin=true 

Advanced Configuration Changes: controller.properties 

The controller configuration file contains additional settings for the controller. The following 
modifications can be adjusted for environments that have higher than normal turnover, or do not 
require extended data retention of deleted resources or objects. 

 Note: Location = /usr/lib/vmwarevcops/user/conf/controller/controller.properties 

Automatically Delete Not Existing Resources 

The user can set not existing resources, those resources and objects that have already been 
deleted in vCenter, to automatically delete This feature helps to keep the vApp clean of old 
resources and objects that are no longer needed.  

#automatically delete not existing resources 

deleteNotExisting = true 

Adjust the Time of Not Existing State 

This setting relates to the Automatically Delete Note Existing Resources setting and controls the 
deletion period in hours that an object must be in the not existing state before it can be deleted. In 
the example below, the Time of Note Existing State is set at 48 hours. This means that, after an 
object is deleted in vCenter, 48 hours must pass before the object is deleted out of vCenter 
Operations. 

#time in hours an object must be in the not existing state before it can be deleted 

deletionPeriodInHours=48

Setting the Resource Deletion Schedule 

This setting configures how often the resource scheduling should run to delete resources of the 
vApp. 

#time in hours between resource deletion scheduling 

deletionSchedulePeriod = 12 

Security 

vCenter Operations Management Advanced Suite 
There are a number of areas where, by default, security is applied to a vCenter Operations 
Management Advanced Suite installation, or can be enhanced with extra configuration. These 
instances include the following: 

  Limiting Exposure to Internal Services 

 

  Embedded Firewall 

 

  Embedded Encryption 

 

  SSL vCenter Operations to Browser Communication 

 

  Use LDAP Authentication 

 

 Following VMware’s best practices for vApps design, vCenter Operations Manager only exposes, 
outside of the vApp, those services that are absolutely required. Specifically, only SSH and 
HTTPS are open to by default.   

The administrator does not have to take action for unnecessary services to be inaccessible. 

Embedded Firewall 

vCenter Operations Manager has a firewall enabled to prevent external attempts to access the 
port probe. The vApp exposes minimal network footprints using only the following ports for 
inbound connections: 

  443 (https) 

 

  22 (ssh) 

 

  80 (redirected to 443) 

 

Additionally, the vApp creates an Open VPN tunnel between the two virtual machines using port 
1194.  

The administrator does not have to take action to enable firewall services. 

Embedded Encryption

VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

vCenter Operations Manager uses the Blowfish encryption protocol to secure all internal user 
accounts and external accounts. For example, this protocol encrypts all user credentials entered 
into vCenter Operations Manager and used to communicate with monitoring tools.   

The administrator does not have to take action to enable user credential encryption. 

Collection Credentials 

While the user credentials necessary to communicate with target monitoring tools are stored and 
encrypted, it is still advised that these credentials be given strong passwords (or passwords that 
follow the organization’s strength-of-password policy). Additionally, specific target monitoring 
tools may only require “read” level access, or some minimal access authority. When this is the 
case, the administrator should grant minimum access rights only.  

SSL vCenter Operations to Browser Communication  

vCenter Operations Manager supports the use of SSL communication for browser-to-server 
communications. The use of SSL for browser-to-server communication is configurable.  

Use LDAP Authentication  

Within the Custom UI, vCenter Operations Manager encrypts user passwords using the Blowfish 
encryption protocol. Note however, that vCenter Operations does not enforce a strength-of-
password policy, nor does it enforce a lockout policy for failed login attempts. The recommended 
best practice is to integrate vCenter Operations with an existing enterprise directory. For 
information about integrating vCenter Operations Manager with LDAP or Active Directory see 
Configure and Managing users in the vCenter Operations Manager Administration Guide. 

Note: URL = https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vcops-57-custom-ui-admin-guide.pdf 

It is recommended that LDAP groups are used for synchronizing LDAP users with their 
appropriate access rights in vCenter Operations Manager. Create an LDAP Group for each of the 
access rights groups in vCenter Operations, and then apply synchronization. Once synchronized, 
any user added to or deleted from the LDAP group will be removed from the vCenter Operations 
Manager group within the one hour synchronization period. Initially, the recommended groups to 
be created in LDAP are Administrators, Operators and Users which will match the out-of-the box 
vCenter Operations Manager groups.  

For the vSphere UI, all rights within vCenter are applied to vCenter Operations Manager which 
enables control of access to resources rather than control of the ability to perform activities as per 
the Custom UI. 

Background and vCenter Operations Manager 

Overview 
This section describes the backup and recovery process for the respective components and 
provides detailed information on how to backup the applications themselves and the external (if 
applicable) databases.  

The following details the unique difficulties associated with backing up and restoring vCenter 
Operations Manager, and the recommended sequence of backup steps that must be adhered to 
in order to ensure a consistent and compatible state after a restore.

VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

Challenges 
vCenter Operations Manager is supplied as a vApp, which means it needs a vApp-aware backup 
solution to ensure backup for the virtual machines and the vApp configuration. While a vApp-
aware backup solution is preferred, there are only a few products with this capability currently on 
the market.  

If a vApp-aware product isn’t available, then traditional VM-based backup and restore steps need 
to be taken. Both VADP and VDR provide this capability.  

Additionally, any backup product, vApp-aware or not, needs evaluation because the backup 
process could cause issues with the function of the VMs in the vApp. Most products of this type 
take a snapshot of the VMs prior to the backup process. Given the nature of the machines, 
especially the Analytics VM which has a large number of write operations, the snapshot may grow 
to some size causing a potential performance problem when committing changes post-backup. 
Additionally, the timing of the backups needs to be considered. The Analytics process starts 
running at midnight, which is also a typical time for running backups. 

The vCenter Operations Manager vApp can be easily “broken” in that a vApp in general can be 
moved out of one cluster and into another cluster with a different network and environment. It is 
also possible to create problems by attempting to apply a restore from a backup of a vCenter 
Operations Manager vApp with a solution that is not vApp-aware. This can result in IP address 
changes and severed connections between the VMs within the vApp. 

If the vCenter Operations Manager vApp does become “broken,” the administrator can repair it by 
running the following command from the UI VM: 

vcops-admin repair –ipaddress <ipaddress of analytics VM> 

Steps to mitigate the problem of the vCenter Operations Manager vApp becoming “broken” are 
planned for a future release. 

Backup and Restore vApps 
As there are currently no known solutions available that address the need to backup a vApp with 
more than one VM, the following guide provides a work around to the problem with manual steps 
to backup and restore the individual VMs. (This procedure is applicable to vCenter Operations 
Manager 5.x.x.)

The restore sequence should be: 

1.  Restore Analytics VM 

2.  Restore UI VM 

One possible way to restore using a VM-based backup solution that isn’t vApp-aware is as 
follows: 

1.  Deploy a fresh installation of vCenter Operations vApp that has the same major and 

minor release version that was backed up and needs to be restored. Make sure the vApp 
is not powered on. 

2.  Restore the backed up VMs but do not power them on. 

3.  Replace the VMDKs (and associated files e.g. .vmx, .vmxf, and so on) of the vApps in 

Step 1 above with the VMDKs from Step 2. 

4.  Power on the vApp. This process should restore the UI VM. It is possible that the 

Analytics VM will go into consistency check mode if the backup was a "hot" a.k.a. "live" 
backup. In this case, it might be necessary to restart the UI VM if it stops waiting for the 
Analytics VM to respond during startup. 

EMC Storage Design 
The VNX storage array provides many features that allow provisioning of the Private Cloud. Since 
this solution is built on top of a VSPEX Private Cloud, it uses the same storage configuration as 
mentioned in the VSPEX Private Cloud proven infrastructure documents. Additional storage 
service levels can be created within a VNX array to achieve different levels of performance. Most 
effectively align resources with performance requirements.  

See EMC VSPEX Private Cloud: VMware vSphere 5.5 Proven Infrastructure Guides for details. 

VNX storage tiering and FAST VP 
As validated in the VSPEX Proven Infrastructure, this solution uses EMC’s FAST VP technology, 
which enables storage tiering within the storage service level. Storage tiering is the assignment of 
data to different types, or tiers, of storage media to reduce total storage cost. FAST VP makes 
automatic storage tiering possible on VNX storage arrays. FAST VP operates by periodically 
relocating the most active data to the highest performance storage tier, while relocating less 
active data to the lower performing storage tiers, as appropriate, when new data is promoted. 

FAST VP uses intelligent algorithms to continuously analyze devices at the sub-LUN level. This 
enables it to identify and relocate the specific parts of a LUN that are most active and would 
benefit from being moved to higher-performing storage such as enterprise flash drives. It also 
identifies the least active parts of a LUN and relocates that data to higher-capacity, more cost-
effective storage. Performance measurement and user-defined policies determine data 
movement between tiers. FAST VP moves the data automatically and non-disruptively.  

The VSPEX Private Cloud uses two disk types within the storage pool with each providing a 
different tier of performance and capacity, as shown in Figure 4

Storage Mapping 
Figure 5 shows how the storage pool and LUNs are mapped to different enterprises within the 
business. The following explains the storage service level’s three cloud types: 

Production clouds are organizational clouds for virtual machines with maximum performance 
requirements. 

Test/Development clouds are organization clouds for virtual machines with medium performance 
requirements. 

Archive/Low Cost clouds are organizational clouds for virtual machines with the least 
performance requirements.

EMC Virtual Storage Integrator (VSI) 
Because VSI is modular in design, administrators can add, remove and update features 
independently providing a flexible, customized user experience. Features available for VSI 
include Storage Viewer, Path Management, Symmetrix storage replication adaptor (SRA), Unified 
Storage Management, AppSync Management, and EMC RecoverPoint Management. 

The three features used in this solution are as follows: 

  Storage Viewer feature extends the VMware vSphere Client to facilitate the discovery 

and identification of VNX storage devices that have been provisioned to ESXi hosts and 
virtual machines. Storage Viewer presents the underlying storage details to the vSphere 
administrator by merging the data of several different storage-mapping tools into a few 
seamless VMware vSphere Client views. 
 

  Path Management feature for VMware Native Multipathing and EMC PowerPath/VE 
provides a mechanism for changing the multipath policy for groups of LUNs based on 
storage class and virtualization objects. 
 

  Unified Storage Management feature provides array-based storage management and 
provisioning for VMAX, VNX, VNXe, CLARiiON, Celerra arrays. This feature also allows 
for virtual machine decompression, compression, cloning and extending datastore 
capacity.

EMC Storage Analytics 
EMC Storage Analytics (ESA) links VMware vCenter Operations Manager with EMC Adapter for 
the VNX family. vCenter Operations Manager displays performance and capacity metrics from 
EMC storage systems with data that the adapter provides by: 
 

  Connecting to, and collecting data from, block and file systems 

 

  Converting the date into a format that vCenter Operations can process 

 

  Passing the date to the vCenter Operations collector 

 

vCenter Operations Manager Advanced presents the aggregated data through alerts, 
dashboards, and in pre-defined reports that end users can easily interpret. EMC Adapter is 
installed with the vCenter Operations administrative user interface. See Figure 6.

VSPEX Private Cloud with Operations Management 
Design and Implementation Guide 

Chapter 5 

Overview 
This chapter shows how to verify that the vCenter Operations Manager was upgraded correctly 
from Standard edition to the Advance edition and that the vCenter Operations Manager is able to 
poll analytic data both from vCenter and EMC storage arrays to present correlative data. 

Verifying vCenter Operations Manager 
Implementation 
Upgrading to vCenter Operations Manager Advanced and installing EMC Storage Analytics 
(ESA) gives the ability to monitor health of a virtual infrastructure and the virtual machines 
running on them. This data can be used to identify the root cause for performance bottlenecks 
across VMs, hosts, and storage. It can also help the IT operations staff plan resources by giving 
predictive data about capacity. 

In order to correlate captured analytic data across hosts and storage systems, vCenter 
Operations Manager needs to interface with vCenter Server as well as EMC Storage Arrays. 
vCenter Operations Manager has adapters that can interface with each subsystem to collect 
analytic data. The following procedure identifies the upgrade of vCenter Operations Manager to 
the Advanced edition and verifies the correct installation of the adapter instances used for data 
collection. 

Verifying the Upgrade to vCenter Operations 
Manager Advanced 
Perform the following steps after upgrading vCenter Operations License in vSphere Client to 
Advance as outlined in Chapter 4: 

1.  Login to the vCenter Operations UI at https://<ip address of vcops>/vcops-vSphere. 

2.  Click the “About” link at the top right corner. 

3.  Advanced edition is listed as per Figure 13. 

Note: If the UI is open before updating the License, please logout and log back in to see the 
updated edition

Server, it needs the adapters for VNX and vCenter to be operational. The following procedure 
verifies that the adapters are running correctly and that they are able to collect metric data from 
both vCenter Server and VNX. 

Verifying EMC Adapter Configurations 
After adding adapters as mentioned in Chapter 4, use the following steps to verify that the EMC 
adapter for vCenter Server and VNX is able to collect data. 

1.  Login to the vCenter Operations Manager Custom UI at https://<ip address of 

vcops>/vcops-custom as seen in Figure 14. 

2.  Click on Environment, Configuration, Adapter Instance, and double click vCenter Server 

adapter. 

3.  Hit the test button to see a success message as shown in Figure 15. 

From the dashboard page, under the Storage Topology dashboard, the adaptor instance is listed 
under Storage system. Similarly, for the EMC storage adapter, the adapter instance test runs 
successfully and is listed under storage system. See Figures 14-18.

Monitoring vCenter Operations Manager Objects 
Management operations in cloud environments include ensuring service levels, problem solving, 
troubleshooting, and preventative maintenance. Successfully meeting these requirements 
involves the analysis of current utilization, forecasting of future needs, and the optimization of 
current resource consumption by reclaiming underutilized resources. 

The in-depth infrastructure and operations information provided by VMware vCenter Operations 
Management Advanced Suite eliminates time-consuming problem resolution processes through 
automated root cause analysis. Self-learning performance analytics and dynamic thresholds 
adapt to the environment to simplify operations management and eliminate false alerts. 
Integrated smart alerts for health, performance, and capacity degradation identify performance 
problems before they affect end users. Advanced capacity analytics allow administrators to 
optimize virtual machine density and identify capacity shortfalls before they affect end users. The 
VMware vCenter Operations Management Advanced Suite provides flexibility with advanced 
features that extend monitoring, analytics, and reporting capabilities and it is suitable for solutions 
of any size. 

vCenter Operations Manager vSphere Dashboard 
Once implemented and configured, the vSphere UI provides a comprehensive insight into the 
environment, as shown in Figure 19. The main dashboard is divided into three logical entities 
providing high-level information about the current overall health and issues of all managed 
resources, potential future issues and risks in the environment, and resource efficiency trends in 
the environment.

Figure 19.  Main vSphere dashboard in vCenter Operations Manager 

 

The three primary logical entities in vCenter Operations Manager can be explained as follows: 
 

  Health calculates health scores based on patented algorithms that dynamically calculate 

thresholds by observing the behavior trends of the cloud environment. This information 
gives visibility into the red, yellow, green status of the virtual machines, datastores, and 
clusters. The administrator can see where the problems are, what the issue is, and if 
there is any pattern of abnormal behavior in the environment. 

  Risk provides insight into the resource consumption to tell the administrator not only 

when the vSphere environment will run out of capacity, but also which resources will run 
out. 

  Efficiency aims to help administrators proactively optimize the environment and reclaim 

waste. 

vCenter Operations Manager Badges 
vCenter Operations Manager uses badges to illustrate derived metrics and to provide an 
overview of the state of the virtual environment or an individual object. These badges serve as 
focus points to narrow the scope of a potential problem and provide details about the cause of the 
problem. 

Major and minor badges are color coded and range from a healthy green to a potentially 
problematic yellow, orange, or red. Badges are organized in a simple hierarchy in which the 
scores of minor badges contribute to the scores of major badges. 

Scores might reflect a healthy state or a potential problem depending on the type of badge. For 
example, low scores for health, time remaining, and capacity remaining might indicate potential 
problems, while low scores for faults, stress, or anomalies indicate a normal state. 

Navigation and Troubleshooting  
The vCenter Operations Manager dashboards provide a wide number of different insights into 
infrastructure condition and enable simple and easy analysis of the root cause of problems. For

example, suppose the overall environment condition for health is represented with a green badge 
value of 85. The administrator can go to the Health Weather Map, hover the mouse over one of 
the red/orange marked areas and get brief information about a fault. In the example used in 
Figure 20, the orange icon on the bottom row of the Health Weather Map is related to a particular 
virtual machine on a VNX datastore, indicated with a Health value of 48 and Anomalies value of 
99.

Monitoring VNX Health and Resources 
vCenter Operations Manager integration with EMC Storage Analytics (ESA) software delivers 
custom analytics and visualizations that provide deep visibility into the EMC infrastructure and 
enable the administrator to troubleshoot, identify, and take quick action on storage performance 
and capacity management problems. 
 
Note: vCenter Operations Manager Advanced is required to integrate with EMC Storage 
Analytics 
 
Within the vCenter Operations Manager custom portal, ESA presents three separate dashboards. 
Two of those dashboards are universal and one is specific to VNX. Each dashboard is fully 
customizable and can be adjusted to display the required details and metrics or additional 
widgets. 
 
By default, ESA enables the following dashboards in the vCenter Operations Manager custom 
portal which provide information about VNX storage systems: 
 

  EMC Storage Topology dashboard – Provides a view of resources and relationships 

between storage and virtual infrastructure objects 

  EMC VNX Storage Metrics dashboard – Displays resource and metrics for the storage 

systems 

  EMC VNX Overview dashboard – Represents a single view of performance and capacity 

of the VNX resources 

Additional dashboards included with ESA are the following: 
 

  EMC VNX Topology 
  EMC VNX Metrics 
  EMC Top-N VNX File Systems 
  EMC Top-N VNX LUNs 
  EMC VNXe Overview 
  EMC VNXe Topology 
  EMC VNXe Metrics 
  EMC Top-N VNXe LUNs and File Systems 

 

EMC Storage Topology Dashboard 
The EMC Storage Topology dashboard, displayed in Figure 22, shows the configured VNX arrays 
also referred to as adapter instances. When an array is selected from the Storage System 
Selector pane, the Topology and Resources panes are populated with associated underlying 
components. ESA pulls in all related VMware objects, making it possible to navigate end-to-end 
into the underlying storage array components. These components include vSphere datastore 
clusters, LUNs, storage pools, and storage processors. The instance in Figure 22 shows that the 
LUN VNX-ESA has datastore emc-vnx built on it. The LUN is created from the Raid group 9 and 
uses Storage Processor A. These details are presented graphically in the Storage Topology and 
Health pane and are also presented as parent and child resources in their respective panes.

The second universal dashboard, shown in Figure 23, is for EMC Storage Metrics. Each EMC 
resource has an associated set of metrics associated displayed in a graph. Navigation is driven 
from the top down, so after choosing the storage system and specific resources, the user can 
select multiple metrics to be displayed in the Metric graph.

EMC VNX Overview Dashboard 
VNX arrays have their own specific dashboard, EMC Performance Overview, which presents 
details in the form of heat maps, as shown in Figure 26. This dashboard covers the main storage 
system resource types including thin pools, storage groups, LUNs, storage processors (VNX), 
FAST Cache Performance (VNX) providing a few metrics from each one. The heat map colors 
work on two different levels. There is a green-to-red legend for some resources types which 
represents either usage (thin pool allocation) or performance (latency). There is a blue legend for 
relative usage across that metric within an array (total writes). For any one of the objects shown, 
a full historical perspective is available on the EMC Storage Metrics page. 
 

Figure 26.  ESA VNX overview 

 

The ESA VNX overview dashboard shows the CPU utilization and health of the Storage 
processors along with detailed metrics on the LUNs such as LUN Utilization, Latency, IOPS, etc. 
In the vCenter Operations Manager standard edition, heat maps related to Storage Processors or 
LUNs are not available. 

Capacity Planning and Optimization 
VMware vCenter Operations Manager provides powerful capacity planning functionalities which 
helps predict behavior and evaluate the potential impact of future growth on the underlying 
resources supporting the enterprise private cloud environment. 
The capacity planning component of vCenter Operations Manager provides statistics on current 
utilization, as shown in Figure 27, but can also provide a prediction for a “What-If” scenario where 
the infrastructure environment may be influenced by an increased or decreased number of ESXi 
hosts, storage, or virtual machines on existing or new consumption profiles. By implementing the 
scenario, vCenter Operations Manager will model the predicted impact so that the administrator 
knows in advance what the capacity requirements will be under the “What-If” scenario 
circumstances.

Figure 27.  Virtual Machine Capacity details for management cluster 

 

As shown in Figure 27, the capacity-remaining figures are based on demand and consumption 
trends of the currently operating virtual machines. To plan for capacity requirements for future 
growth, the administrator can create a “What-If” scenario which contains a virtual machine profile 
that can be based on an existing virtual machine, or even specified manually. 
 

Figure 28.   “What-if” scenarios 

 

As shown in Figure 28, the virtual machine profile can be tailored to specify not only the allocation 
of resources, but also their actual usage and consumption. Once this scenario of adding ten new 
virtual machines has been successfully run through, the details displayed for virtual machine 
capacity are updated to display the current actual capacity remaining as well as the potential 
capacity if the “What-If scenario” was implemented, as shown in Figure 29.

Standard. It is not possible to determine any extra details on the problems since the storage 
system is offline. However, Figures 32-33 shows that, when using vCenter Operations Manager 
Advanced with ESA, there is additional information available. Looking at the health tree of the 
virtual machine, there are three alerts on the VM and six alerts on a child resource which is the 
datastore used by this VM. Clicking on the alerts for the child resource shows a critical alert—the 
storage connectivity is lost between the host and the storage system.

Root Cause Analysis: Disk Failure 
The VNX Overview dashboard gives the hierarchal overview of the various storage elements 
associated with a virtual machine. The dashboard collects alerts and health information at each 
level in the hierarchy. The hierarchy starts from the virtual machine and extends to the datastore 
as follows: 
 
datastore-> Storage Processor-> LUN -> Storage Pool -> Raid Group -> Disks, etc. 
If there is a fault in any of the subsystems, the specific area can be pinpointed easily by looking at 
the hierarchical view on the VNX Overview dashboard.  
 
Figure 33 shows the VNX overview dashboard with a hierarchy for a virtual machine that has 
storage on a datastore with LUN ‘VNX_ESA’. The hierarchy shows all the associated elements 
with the LUN all the way to the disks that are part of the Raid Group supporting the LUN. 
 

Figure 33.  VNX Dashboard 

 

Disk # 1 on Bus1, Enclosure 2 of the VNX has a fault as seen in Figure 34. The image shows a 
hierarchy indicating a Disk is at fault in the LUN that was in use by a virtual machine. Clicking on 
the VNX Metric dashboard and selecting the faulted disk shows a red box indicating associated 
events that are causing the disk’s health status to turn red. The resource event indicates that this 
disk is at fault.

Overview: vCenter Operations Manager vApp 
Sizing Considerations 

 
Prior to deploying the vCenter Operations Manager vApp, it is important to understand the size of 
the target environment. The vCenter Operations Manager Installation Guide defines scale in 
terms of virtual machine count. The following table summarizes these requirements. 

Table 1.  vCenter Operations Manager vApp sizing examples.  

 

Note: The disk I/O requirements represent an aggregate requirement for the entire vApp; 
however the majority of the I/O generated is a result of the metrics collection from the Analytics 
VM. Furthermore the I/O is typically biased towards write operations; the exception being the 
daily analytics process that results in large quantities of combined reads and writes in order to 
update the metrics contained in the FSDB. 

Detailed CPU and RAM Considerations Explained 

Although the sizing guidance from the installation guide defines environment scale with respect to 
the quantity of virtual machines, it is important to recognize that this has been adopted to provide 
a familiar approach for customers to understand. The real determining factor influencing the

deployment configuration, in particular for CPU and memory, is the number of metrics being 
collected. In fact, the previously defined VM-based sizing recommendations from the vCenter 
Operations Manager Installation Guide are actually derived using some simple metric-based 
assumptions, as follows: 

  Virtual machines generate 250 metrics 

  ESXi host generate 1,500 metrics 

  ESXi hosts offer a consolidation ratio of 10:1 

Using these assumptions in conjunction with the previously defined VM-based sizing approach, it 
is possible to determine the amount of metrics the configuration will support. This is calculated as 
follows: 

(#VMs x 250 metrics) + ((#VMs/10 VMs per host) x 1,500 metrics) = total metrics 

Applying this calculation to the defined VM-based sizing approach results in the following total 
metric counts: 

 

(Pre-defined Small) 1,500 virtual machines and 600,000 metrics 

o  For the purposes of this solution guide, the “small” configuration is suitable. From 

Figure 3, the small configuration will require 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, and 900 GB 
storage space. 

 

 

(Pre-defined Medium) 3,000 virtual machines and 1,200,000 metrics 

(Pre-defined Large) 6,000 virtual machines and 2,400,000 metrics 

These metrics relate specifically to the use of vCenter Operations in conjunction with the vCenter 
Server adapter only and do not include the use of additional external adapters. If there is a 
requirement to collect further data from additional adapters then there is a requirement to 
understand the total number of metrics this is likely to introduce. For example, if a SCOM 
(Microsoft Systems Center Operations Manager) adapter were also introduced, and it were to 
collect an additional 250 metrics per guest operating system, then an environment comprising 
1,500 VMs would need to be sized for 975,000 metrics. In other words, the deployment sizing 
would need to be determined using a linear extrapolation of the 600,000 metric based sizing. 

Note: The three sizing tiers discussed translate to the “small,” “medium,” and “large” configuration 
options available when deploying the vApp. The most current sizing requirements for the vApp 
appear in the VMware knowledge base paper at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2057607 

Note:  EMC VSPEX defines a standard reference virtual machine to be composed of 1 vCPU, 2 
GB RAM, and 100 GB storage space. The “small” vCenter Operations Manager vApp is equal to 
9 VSPEX reference virtual machines. For more details on reference virtual machines refer to 
EMC VSPEX Private Cloud: VMware vSphere 5.5 Proven Infrastructure Guides  

Currently, vCenter Operations Manager is indicated as being limited to a maximum of 6,000 
virtual machines. It should be noted that this is derived from the limitation of vSphere Virtual 
Hardware 7 that is restricted to a maximum of 8 vCPUs. The availability of vSphere 5.x, and in 
particular the introduction of Virtual Hardware 8, means this is no longer a constraint and, in 
theory, vCenter Operations Manager can support larger configurations.

Java™ VM Configuration 
Another critical aspect of the vCenter Operations vApp sizing considerations involves applying 
best practice recommendations for running Java based applications. The vCenter Operations 
vApp comprises a UI VM and an Analytics VM that supports a number of key functions, which are 
Java based applications. Running Java applications in virtualized environments presents a 
unique challenge due to the manner in which a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manages memory 
internally. This additional layer of memory management causes complications with the VMware 
Tools balloon driver. This complication arises from the guest operating system having no visibility 
into how the Java application uses memory and therefore is unable to determine which memory 
pages should be swapped. The result is that during periods of ESXi host memory contention the 
VMware Tools driver could induce performance degradation more akin to VMkernel swapping as 
the benefits of ballooning cannot be realized. This effect is described in the Love Your Balloon 
Driver blog in the VMware Communities. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to apply virtual 
machine memory reservations in line with the JVM Heap Size, Permanent Generation, and Stack 
Size. The Java memory requirements can be calculated as follows: 

Java Max Heap Size + JVM Perm Gen + #Threads x Stack Size = JVM Memory Requirement 

In order to apply the previously defined formula, it is necessary to understand how these 
parameters are defined for the vCenter Operations application components. In the case of the 
vCenter Operations vApp, the Heap Size parameters are defined dynamically based on the 
configured memory for the virtual machine; the other parameters are fixed. These parameters are 
defined as follows:

If the memory considerations defined in the previous table are applied in relation to defining

Note: The example reservation calculations exclude the variable Stack Size requirements 
required per thread. The purpose for these calculations is to provide a justification for the required 
large virtual machine memory reservation. Given the variable nature of the stack size component, 
the lack of control of which memory is allocated to a Java process, and general manageability, it 
may be worth simply reserving the entire VM memory allocations. 

Detailed Storage Capacity and I/O Considerations 
Storage sizing considerations are again defined based on the scale of monitored environment. 
Although the installation guide defines scale in terms of virtual machine count, this is again aimed 
at achieving familiarity for customers. As with the CPU and memory sizing recommendation, the 
considerations for storage sizing are more accurately defined by metric count. This is true for both

capacity and I/O requirements. The capacity requirements for vCenter Operations are derived 
from a product of the following parameters: 

  Metric count 

  Metric collection frequency (every 5 minutes) 

  Metric retention period (default of 6 months) 

  Metric storage requirement (16 bytes per metric) 

Using these assumptions in conjunction with the previously defined VM-based sizing approach, it 
is possible to determine the amount of storage capacity required. This is calculated as follows:
