INFRASTRUCTURE:

The end-to-end compute to storage 
infrastructure - Virtual Machine to 

the Logical Unit of Storage

PERFORMANCE:

Continuous measurement of 
system-wide infrastructure 

response time

MANAGEMENT:

Advanced correlation, analysis, 
and visualization for definitive 

and actionable insight

IT Priorities (Forrester Research)

• 40% of budget goes to infrastructure. Urgent need 
to align Infrastructure and Application Performance

• What can go wrong with Fast Storage?

– Slow HBA Ingestion
– B2B Depletion
– Performance heavily dependent on dynamic IO-

profiles

– ISL Congestions

Applied Analytics

• Based on years of experience – turning data into answers
• Focuses on the critical findings that exist beyond your raw data 
• Provides the required, built in algorithmic logic necessary

• Event Advisor – Find emergent and anomalous events

– Specify a given metric or set of metrics and timeframe
– “Ask the platform” if there are any emergent trends or events 
– Provides list of ‘ranked’ events, the associated entities and metrics

Event Advisor – Find the anomalies that exist in your environment

• Provides the required, built in algorithmic logic necessary

• Trend Matcher – Find all corollary trends in seconds

– Provide a source trend, identified by either Event Advisor or a user 
– Compare the provided trend with every entity in the database 
– Finds and displays a list of ‘suspect’ entities or devices sorted by correlation 

Trend Matcher – Scour all your data for correlation and causality
