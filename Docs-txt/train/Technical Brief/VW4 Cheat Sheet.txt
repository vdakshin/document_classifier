VirtualWisdom4 Cheat Sheet (VI Internal Only) 

VirtualWisdom Platform Appliance and Virtual Edition 

Current version: 

  VirtualWisdom: 4.0.5. Customers running 4.0.0 must upgrade to 4.0.1 first and then to 4.0.4 and then to 4.0.5. 

Upgrading directly from 4.0.1 (all new Appliances ship with this release) to 4.0.5 will “brick” our Appliances. 4.0.6, 
which will ship sometime during w/c 10/6, will correct this. 

o  N.B. VW 4.0.3-HotFix1 cannot be upgraded to 4.0.5 without the assistance of Support (only went to one 

customer: CGH). See Release Notes for more information. 

  ProbeFC8: 3.0.1 (VW4), 2.0.4 (VW3) 

 
Probe Count Limits: 

  Appliance has no empirical limits (although there surely is a limit; this will be added once Engineering completes their 

scalability testing) 

  Virtual Edition is limited to 1,024 ProbeSW switch ports, 16 ProbeFC8 links, 50 ProbeVM ESXi servers and 20 NetApp 

storage nodes. 

 
N.B. Exceed these limits at your own risk; neither Support nor Engineering will provide support when limits are exceeded. 
 
General Compatibility: 

  ProbeFCX, Xgig, and roving are no longer supported 
  Cisco DCNM and Brocade BNA versions: see below 
 
  NetApp version 8.2 (cluster configuration only) 

vCenter and ESX version 5.1 and higher (vApp environments are not supported) 

 
Documentation: 

  Release Notes for the current release; this is also where you’ll find port usage information 
  VW4 User Guide (SFDC > Libraries > Product Documentation > “4.x” tag) 
  VW Platform Appliance 4210 Guide (SFDC > Libraries > Product Documentation > “Setup Guide” tag) 
  VW Management Software, Virtual Edition Setup Guide (SFDC > Libraries > Product Documentation > “Setup Guide” 

tag) 
SFDC Articles: review before each deployment. 

 

  
All end user documents are also located on the FTP site (ftp.virtualinstruments.com) in the “CURRENT/Documentation” folder. 
The instructions for accessing the FTP site are here. 
 
Product Bundles: Located on the FTP site in the “CURRENT” directory: 

  Virtual Edition VM images (use only for new deployments): 

o  pa-mfg-ova.4.0.5-1768.x86_64.ova 

  VW4 update bundles (can be applied to either Appliance or Virtual Edition deployments): 

o  pa-release-update-4.0.1-1661.upd (for 4.0.0 to 4.0.1 upgrades) 
o  pa-release-update-4.0.5-1768.upd 

  FC8 bundles 

o  hd48-release-update-3.0.1-1813.upd (in the directory “Hardware/ProbeFC8”) 
  

Appliance Best Practices: 

  For customers with more than one Appliance/VE instance, use separate network share drives for each instance 
  When connecting a customer browser to an Appliance for first run, make sure any proxy settings are cleared 

 
SFDC: RemoteWisdom does not currently update the version in the release object; must do so manually 

Cisco Deployments 

Compatibility: 

  Cisco DCNM versions 6.2.5 and 6.3.1(a); must be 64-bit. 6.3.1(a) is preferred and we should try to get customers to 

move to this release if at all possible. Cisco SANs with PortChanneling configured must use 6.3.1(a) 

  Not supported: SANtap, Cisco IVR, trunked ISLs, UCS FEX, and TACACS+ authentication

 

VirtualWisdom4 Cheat Sheet (VI Internal Only) 
Increase DCNM heap space: In the file $INSTALLDIR/dcm/fm/conf/CiscoSMIS.conf, modify 
wrapper.java.maxmemory=value, where value is 4096 for 1 – 10,000 switch ports and 8192 for greater than 10,000 
switch ports 

  Make sure that DCNM has completed discovery before attempting to configure ProbeSW 
  For deployments that include UCS, DCNM assumes that all switches share the same credentials 
  When a device is moved to a new SAN port (and associated with new FCID) DCNM 6.2.5(a) will provide two responses 

to VirtualWisdom discovery: one for the obsolete FCID and one for the new FCID. They are duplicates so VW4 cannot 
tell the difference and the result is that the ports are ignored and monitoring will not occur for that device. This is 
handled correctly in 6.3.1(a). 

Brocade Deployments 

Compatibility: 

  Brocade BNA version 12.0.2 and higher 
  Not supported: Brocade LISLs (resulting from XISL use), FC-FC routing, trunked ISLs 

 
Deployment Best Practices: 

 

Increase BNA heap space: In the file $INSTALLDIR/conf/cimomsvc.conf, modify set.MAX_HEAP_SIZE=value, where 
value is 1024m for 1-1,000 switch ports, 2048m for 1,000-2,560 switch ports, and 4096m for greater than 2,560 
switch ports. 

  Make sure that BNA has completed discovery before attempting to configure ProbeSW 

ProbeSW 

ProbeSW Best Practices: 

  4.0.5 added a method by which misidentified device types can be corrected. See the release notes for more 

information on this feature. 

  For deployments with multiple ProbeSW probes, you must stagger the discovery times, as parallel SMI-S discoveries 

are not supported. 

  Do not change the names of automatically created entities. 
  VW4 discovers aliases in the following order: Device Alias (4.0.2 and above), FCALIAS, FCID and WWN. 
  FCALIAS Hierarchy (within BNA/DCNM) 

o  Logical Fabric 

  Zone Set (must be the active zone set) 

  Zone 

o  FCALIAS (BNA: “zone alias” not “alias”) 

  PWWN (cannot be FCID or device alias) 

ProbeFC8 

Compatibility: VW4 requires firmware version 3.0.1 or higher. Should a probe need to be reset for use with VW3, a 
downgrade procedure is defined in the internal version of the 2.0.4 release notes. 
 
ProbeFC8 Best Practices: 

  When connecting a customer browser to a ProbeFC8-HD48 for first run, make sure any proxy settings are cleared 
 

It is highly recommended that AEs carry a 2.0.4 USB stick with them. Services may downgrade probes in the field to 
switch a deployment from VW4 to VW3. All other use cases (e.g., failed upgrade) must be handled through Support.  
This USB stick needs to be an 8g (no larger, no smaller) overwritten with either pfc8-2.0.4.image (for 
ProbeFC8/FC8HD) or hd48-2.0.4.image (for ProbeFC8-HD48) available on the Services FTP site 
(ftp.virtualinstruments.com) in the folder “Firmware/FC8/Boomstick”.  

  Link Association (automatic or manual) requires: 

o  ProbeSW discovery completed, 

  Requires SMI-S providers to complete their discovery first, followed by ProbeSW configuration and 

full discovery 

o  ProbeFC8 subscribed long enough (8 min typically) for NTP to synchronize and provide relevant data 

  Requires VW Appliance to have NTP 

o  Health Diagnostics showing no link errors

ProbeVM 

VirtualWisdom4 Cheat Sheet (VI Internal Only) 

Feature: In VW4, it’s now possible to select exactly which ESX hosts to monitor during probe configuration. 
 
ProbeVM Best Practices: 

  For every deployment until 4.1.0 ships, you must alter a property for the ProbeVM vCenter Proxy service (VW Health 
tab in VW4 UI): com.vi.vmware.cluster.vcenters=IP1,IP2,… where IP1 is the IP address of the first vCenter server, IP2 
is the IP address of the second vCenter server, etc.
