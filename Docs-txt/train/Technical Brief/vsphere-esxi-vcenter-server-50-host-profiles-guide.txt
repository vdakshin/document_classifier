Managing Host Profiles

The host profiles feature creates a profile that encapsulates the host configuration and helps to manage the
host configuration, especially in environments where an administrator manages more than one host or cluster
in vCenter Server.
Host profiles eliminates per-host, manual, or UI-based host configuration and maintains configuration
consistency and correctness across the datacenter by using host profile policies. These policies capture the
blueprint of a known, validated reference host configuration and use this to configure networking, storage,
security, and other settings on multiple hosts or clusters. You can then check a host or cluster against a profile’s
configuration for any deviations.

Host Profiles Usage Model

You perform host profiles tasks in a certain workflow order.
You must have an existing vSphere installation with at least one properly configured host.
1

Set up and configure the host that will be used as the reference host.
A reference host is the host from which the profile is created.
Create a profile using the designated reference host.

2
3 Attach a host or cluster to the profile.
4

Check the host's compliance to the reference host's profile. If all hosts are compliant with the reference
host, they are correctly configured.

5 Apply the host profile of the reference host to other hosts or clusters of hosts.
Using host profiles is only supported for VMware vSphere 4.0 hosts or later. This feature is not supported for
VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier hosts. If you have VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier hosts managed by
your vCenter Server 4.0 or later, the following problems can occur if you try to use host profiles for those hosts:
You cannot create a host profile that uses a VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier host as a reference host.
You cannot apply a host profile to any VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier hosts. The compliance check
fails.

n

n

n While you can attach a host profile to a mixed cluster that contains VMware Infrastructure 3.5 or earlier

hosts, the compliance check for those earlier hosts fails.

As a licensed feature of vSphere, host profiles are only available when the appropriate licensing is in place. If
you see errors, ensure that you have the appropriate vSphere licensing for your hosts.
If you want the host profile to use directory services for authentication, the reference host needs to be configured
to use a directory service. See the vSphere Security documentation.

vSphere Host Profiles

Hosts Provisioned with vSphere® Auto Deploy

For hosts provisioned with vSphere Auto Deploy, vCenter Server owns the entire host configuration, which
is captured in a host profile. In most cases, the host profile information is sufficient to store all configuration
information. Sometimes the user is prompted for input when the host provisioned with Auto Deploy boots.
The answer file mechanism manages those cases. See the vSphere Installation and Setup documentation.

Access Host Profiles View

The Host Profiles main view lists all available profiles. Administrators can also use the Host Profiles main view
to perform operations on host profiles and configure profiles.
The Host Profiles main view should be used by experienced administrators who wish to perform host profile
operations and configure advanced options and policies. Most operations such as creating new profiles,
attaching entities, and applying profiles can be performed from the Hosts and Clusters view.

Procedure

u Select View > Management > Host Profiles.
Any existing profiles are listed on the left side in the profiles list. When a profile is selected from the profile
list, the details of that profile are displayed on the right side.

Creating a Host Profile

You create a new host profile by using the designated reference host's configuration.
A host profile can be created from:
n Host Profile main view

n

host's context menu

Create a Host Profile from Host Profiles View

You can create a host profile from the Host Profiles main view using the configuration of an existing host.

Edit a Policy

A policy describes how a specific configuration setting should be applied. The Profile Editor allows you to edit
policies belonging to a specific host profile.
On the left side of the Profile Editor, you can expand the host profile. Each host profile is composed of several
subprofiles that are designated by functional group to represent configuration instances. Each subprofile
contains many policies and compliance checks that describe the configuration that is relevant to the profile.
You can configure certain subprofiles, example policies, and compliance checks.
Each policy consists of one or more options that contains one or more parameters. Each parameter consists of
a key and a value. The value can be one of a few basic types, for example integer, string, string array, or integer
array.

password.

Configure settings for a service.

Modify advanced options.

n Use the vSphere CLI to configure or modify

the NMP and PSA policies on a reference
host first, and then extract the host profile
from that host. If you use the Profile Editor
to edit the policies, to avoid compliance
failures, make sure that you thoroughly
understand interrelationships between the
NMP and PSA policies and the consequences
of changing individual policies. For
information on the NMP and PSA, see the
vSphere Storage documentation.

n Setting values for the Initiator IPv6 Address

and Initiator IPv6 Prefix options in a host
profile with independent hardware iSCSI
adapters has no effect on the HBA because
no independent iSCSi HBAs have IPv6
support.

When DHCPv6 is enabled in the networking sub-
profile, the corresponding ruleset must also be
manually turned on in the firewall subprofile.

For the time zone, enter a UTC string. For
example, "America/Los_Angeles" for United
States Pacific time zone.
The default time zone is set to the local time and
location of the vSphere Client machine.
Network Time Protocol (NTP) should be
correctly configured. You can configure the NTP
settings on the host's configuration tab. Click
Time Configuration, then Properties at the top
right of the panel.

n Host Profiles do not check advanced settings

if they are the same as the default settings.
vCenter Server only copies the advanced
configuration settings that have changed
and differ from the default values. In
addition, compliance checks are limited to
only the settings that are copied.

n Host Profiles does not support the

configuration of PCI devices for virtual
machine passthrough on the ESXi host.

Other profile configuration categories include: user group, authentication, kernel module, DCUI keyboard,
host cache settings, SFCB, resource pools, login banner, SNMP agent, power system, and CIM indication
subscriptions.

Procedure

1 Open the Profile Editor for the profile to edit.

2 On the left side of the Profile Editor, expand a subprofile until you reach the policy to edit.
3

Select the policy.
On the right side of the Profile Editor, the policy options and parameters are displayed on the
Configuration Details tab.
Select a policy option from the drop-down menu and set its parameter.
Click OK when you are finished editing the profile.

NOTE   The change is made when the "Update host profile" task is completed in the Recent Tasks status.
If you attempt to apply the profile before the task is complete, the profile configuration does not contain
the change.

(Optional) If you make a change to a policy, but want to revert back to the default option, click Revert and
the option is reset.

Enable Compliance Check

You can decide whether a host profile policy is considered during compliance check.

Procedure

1 Open the Profile Editor for a profile and navigate to the policy you wish to enable for compliance check.
2 On the right side of the Profile Editor, select the Compliance Details tab.
3

Enable the check box for the policy.

NOTE   The check box is enabled by default. If you disable the check box so this policy is not checked for
compliance, the other policies that are enabled for compliance check will still be checked.

Manage Profiles

After you create a host profile, you can manage the profile by attaching a profile to a particular host or cluster
and then applying that profile to the host or cluster.
You can associate a profile and a host or cluster either by attaching the profile to the host or cluster, or by
attaching the host or cluster to the profile. You can then apply the profile to the host or cluster.

NOTE   A host profile must have a valid reference host associated with it before you can manage the profile.

Attaching Host or Cluster Entities to a Host Profile

If you want to set up a host to use the same configuration as a reference host, you can attach the host to a profile.
You can also attach a cluster to a profile.
Profiles can also be attached to a cluster. In order to be compliant, all hosts within an attached cluster must be
configured according to the profile. Hosts are not automatically configured in accordance to the host profile
that is attached with the cluster when it is added to the cluster. When a host is added to a cluster that is attached
to a profile, the host is automatically attached to the profile.
You can attach a host or cluster to a profile from:
n Host Profiles main view
n Host's context menu
n Cluster's context menu
n Cluster's Profile Compliance tab

Managing Host Profiles

Attach Entities from the Host Profiles View
Before you can apply the profile to an entity (host or cluster of hosts), you need to attach the entity to the profile
or the profile to the entity.
You can attach a host or cluster to a profile from the Host Profiles main view.
When a host profile is attached to a cluster, the host or hosts within that cluster are also attached to the host
profile. However, when the host profile is detached from the cluster, the association between the host or host
within the cluster and that host profile remains.

Click OK to close the dialog.

Attach Profiles from the Host
Before you can apply the profile to a host you need to attach the host to the profile or the profile to the host.
You can attach a profile to a host from the host's context menu in the Hosts and Clusters inventory view.
When a host profile is attached to a cluster, the host or hosts within that cluster are also attached to the host
profile. However, when the host profile is detached from the cluster, the association between the host or host
within the cluster and that host profile remain.

Procedure

The host profile is updated in the Summary tab of the host.

Applying Profiles

To bring a host to the desired state as specified in the profile, apply the profile to the host.
You can apply a profile to a host from:
n Host Profiles main view
n Host's context menu
n Cluster's Profile Compliance tab
If the profile is not applied, or configured to what is specified in the profile, it will cause the compliance status
for the profile to fail the next time a compliance check is performed. You fix this by applying the profile to the
host.

In the dialog box, click Detach to detach the profile from the cluster or
Change to attach a different profile to the cluster.

Updating Profiles From the Reference Host

If the configuration of the host from which a profile was created (the reference host) changes, you can update
the local profile so that the local host configuration matches the reference host's configuration.
Once you create a host profile, you might need to make incremental updates to the profile. You can do this
using two methods:
n Make the configuration changes to the reference host in the vSphere Client, then update the profile from
the reference host. The settings within the existing profile are updated to match those of the reference host.

n Update the profile directly using the Profile Editor.
While updating the profile from the Profile Editor can be more comprehensive and provide more options,
updating the profile from the reference host allows you to validate the configuration before rolling it out to
other hosts that are attached to the profile.
Updating the profile from the reference host is performed from the Host Profiles main view.

Procedure

u In the Host Profiles main view, right-click the profile you want to update and select Update Profile From

Reference Host.

Enable a Profile Configuration

You can select which profile and policy configurations are active when a host profile is applied.
Enabling and disabling a profile affects whether or not compliance is checked against the sub-profile.

NOTE   If a sub-profile is disabed and the host's configuration that is related to that sub-profie is non compliant,
it does not affect the overall compliance status.

A disabled configuration is not applied when applying the host profile. Hosts are not checked for
compliance with a disabled configuration.
Click OK.

Checking Compliance

Checking compliance ensures that the host or cluster continues to be correctly configured.
After a host or cluster is configured with the reference host profile, a manual change, for example, can occur,
making the configuration incorrect. Checking compliance on a regular basis ensures that the host or cluster
continues to be correctly configured.

Managing Profiles for Hosts Provisioned with vSphere Auto Deploy

For hosts provisioned with Auto Deploy, the answer file contains the user input policies for a host profile. The
file is created when the profile is initially applied to a particular host.
To apply a host profile to a host, the host must be placed into maintenance mode. During this process, the user
is prompted to type answers for policies that are specified during host profile creation.
Placing the host into maintenance mode each time you apply a profile to the host can be costly and time
consuming. A host provisioned with Auto Deploy can be rebooted while the host profile is attached to the
host. After rebooting values stored in the answer file help the host provisioned with Auto Deploy to apply the
profile. An answer file is created that contains a series of key value pairs for the user input options.

NOTE   If you deploy ESXi through host profiles, the syslog utility should be configured. See “Set Up Syslog
from the Host Profiles Interface,” on page 18 for instructions. See the information about Auto Deploy in the
vSphere Installation and Setup documentation.

Check Answer File Status

The answer file status indicates the state of the answer file. The status of an answer file can be complete,
incomplete, missing, or unknown.

Prerequisites

The answer file status can only be checked when the ost profile is atached to a host.

Procedure

u In the host profiles view, click Check Answer File.
The Answer File Status for the host profile is updated. The status indicates one of the following states:

Incomplete

Complete

Unknown

The answer file is missing some of the required user input answers.

2

Right-click the host entity and select Export Answer File.
Select the location to save the answer file.

Set Up Syslog from the Host Profiles Interface

Hosts provisioned with Auto Deploy usually do not have sufficient local storage to save system logs. You can
specify a remote syslog server for those hosts by setting up a reference host, saving the host profile, and
applying that host profile to other hosts as needed.
Best practice is to set up the syslog server on the reference host with the vSphere Client or the esxcli system
syslog command and save the host profile. In some situations, setting up syslog from the Host Profiles interface
is an alternative.

Prerequisites

If you intend to use a remote syslog host, set up that host before you customize host profiles.

Procedure

1 Use a vSphere Client to connect to the vCenter Server system.
