VMware vCloud Air
Enterprise IT Hybrid Data Center

Purpose and Overview
VMware vCloud® Air™ has been developed with a vast number of use cases in mind. The purpose of this paper is 
to provide an example of the enterprise IT/outsourced data center in the form of a case study. This use case forms 
the foundation for subsequent solution briefs. By understanding this foundational building block, users will be 
better prepared to fully grasp the concepts described in other solution briefs. 

This study focuses primarily on the need for organizations to leverage public cloud resources for enterprise IT use. 
When enterprise IT has access to public cloud resources, it can react to business requests more rapidly while still 
maintaining the level of control that today’s enterprises demand.

The focus of this case study is on describing the basic foundation of the outsourced data center as it relates to 
modern enterprise IT operations.

1.1 Background
Enterprise IT customers are approaching a crossroads where on-premises capacity is becoming limited. In addition, 
the speed of the business is in many cases outpacing the speed at which IT can deliver the necessary infrastructure. 
Previously, IT teams have been required to design, procure, install, configure and manage an increasing number 
of discrete infrastructures to satisfy the business’s needs. This process takes time to complete and can slow 
down the progress of business itself. Even the seemingly simple task of adding capacity to existing VMware 
vSphere® infrastructure often must go through a long internal vetting and approval process.

vCloud Air provides IT organizations with quick and easy access to compute, memory and storage resources by 
adding capacity derived from VMware vCloud Suite® to their on-premises data center. By having infrastructure as 
a service (IaaS) based on VMware technology readily available, IT organizations can quickly deploy new workloads 
and migrate existing ones to vCloud Air without having to modify components at the application layer. However, 
to make a functional outsourced data center and hybrid cloud, the following key considerations must be addressed 
before this process of deployment and migration of new and existing workloads begins:

•	Establishing	and	configuring	cloud	networks
•	Connecting	on-premises	vSphere	to	vCloud	Air
•	Deploying	supporting	infrastructure
•	Migrating	templates	and	media

After these four basic issues have been properly addressed, users can view their outsourced data center as ready 
to accept workloads. This document aims to improve users’ understanding of these considerations so they are 
fully prepared to embrace the cloud at their own pace in this new era of IT as a service.

1.2 Target Audience
This document is intended for vSphere architects as well as administrators. Although this will not be an in-depth, 
step-by-step walk-through on how to configure the concepts discussed, both groups will gain a better understanding 
of how various aspects of an outsourced data center might work and can therefore adapt these concepts to their 
own environments. Because the requirements of each subscriber can greatly differ, we will not address the 
following specific topics in detail in this case study:

•	Compliance
•	Licensing
•	Third-party	tools

Design of the Outsourced Data Center
Understanding how to design an outsourced data center is relatively simple. In most cases, it should be viewed and 
treated like any other data center the IT department controls. Instead of a physical, brick-and-mortar computing 
environment, this design, with respect to what is exposed to the end users and administrators, is different because 
it is entirely software defined. By providing subscription-based access to vCloud Air, VMware has eliminated the 
need to build, manage and update the actual infrastructure. Users can design and configure the core services

they need, and then start deploying workloads immediately. This enables IT organizations to focus on meeting 
business needs instead of on managing the underlying infrastructure itself. It is assumed that users already have 
decided to subscribe to one or both of the following two currently available “compute” options:
•	VMware	vCloud	Air	Virtual	Private	Cloud
•	VMware	vCloud	Air	Dedicated	Cloud

2.1 Deploy vCloud Networks
With both compute service options, every customer is given access to a VMware vCloud Networking and 
Security	Edge™	gateway.	In	the	case	of	vCloud	Air	Dedicated	Cloud,	users	can	choose	to	deploy	additional	
vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateways. Each deployed gateway delivers as many as nine interfaces 
that can be used to define vCloud Air networks. All of these networks share the following attributes that can  
and should be unique to each network. Not all of them must be configured according to the use case presented,  
but they are all made available as part of each offering.

•	NAT and firewall – Both of these are enabled by default, with no firewall rules defined and all traffic denied  

as the default rule.

•	A vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway IP address – This is the address that will be assigned to  

the vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway interface where the network is routed.

•	Domain Name System (DNS) server configuration – vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway can 

provide	DNS,	but	an	alternate	server	can	be	specified.

•	Static IP pool range – This is a pool of NAT IP addresses that will be consumed when deploying virtual machines.
•	DHCP
•	Load balancing
• IPsec virtual private network (VPN)

NOTE: vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateways support 10 interfaces, but one interface is used for “external” 
access when a public IP is assigned to it. Subscribers are given public IP addresses as part of the subscription service 
with both offerings, and additional IP addresses can be added at any time through the service interface.

Figure 1 is a logical diagram showing various networks as well as example IP addresses.

2.1.1 Configure Firewall and NAT Rules
After the basic network segments have been decided on, it is important to create some firewall rules. Previously, 
it was noted that by default there are no rules configured. As mentioned, subscribers are also given a number of 
public IP addresses they can use with both offerings. That number, by default, depends on the service type but 
can be expanded at any time. The following are examples of rules that might be necessary to create, using the 
networks shown in the diagram as reference:

Ru lE

Allow All Outbound

Sou RCE

Internal:Any

Allow	Private	to	Desktop

192.168.50.0/24:Any

DESTInATI on

External:Any

192.168.51.0/24:Any

192.168.50.0/24:Any

NOTE: All virtual machines on a vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway segment use the vCloud Networking 
and Security Edge gateway as their default gateway. The preceding rules enable all segments to get direct Internet 
access but also enable the “private” segment to communicate to the “desktop” network. The “DMZ” is denied 
access to both.

For machines to get direct access to the Internet, one or more source NAT (SNAT) rules also must be defined.

2.2 Connect Networks to On-Premises Data Center
The new vCloud Air networks described can access the Internet. In the case of two networks, desktop and 
private, they can also now communicate with each other through the vCloud Networking and Security Edge 
gateway via the previously defined firewall rules. This is useful, but they as of yet have no connection back to the 
on-premises data center. To bridge these networks, we provide the following three options to connect vCloud 
Air to the on-premises data center:

•	IPsec	VPN
•	Direct	connect
•	Data	center	extension/stretch	deploy

NOTE: Although an MPLS-based direct connection has been announced, this connectivity option will be 
discussed in a follow-up document. In addition, data center extension is currently available and will be discussed 
in another document.

For the purposes of this case study, we will focus on IPsec VPN. vCloud Air Edge gateways can work with any 
number of IPsec-compliant devices on premises. Figure 3 is an example of a configured IPsec VPN in vCloud Air. 
(Refer here for more information about configuring IPsec VPN.)

Figure 3. Configured IPsec VPN in vCloud Air

T E C H N I C A L  W H I T E  p A p E R  /   6

VMware vCloud Air

After configuration, the IPsec tunnel will be established. However, firewall rules must still be defined to allow 
traffic to pass. As mentioned previously, by default there are no rules defined. For this use case, the private 
network in vCloud Air must allow traffic to the corporate network on premises and vice versa. Therefore, the  
rules in the vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway might resemble the following:

Ru lE

Sou RCE

Allow Private to OnPrem

192.168.50.0/24:Any

Allow onPrem to Private

192.168.110.0/24:Any

DESTInATI on

192.168.110.0/24:Any

192.168.50.0/24:Any

At this point, traffic can flow successfully between the networks. This configuration provides the most basic 
connectivity through the IPsec VPN tunnel between the two networks without any port restrictions. 

NOTE: If browser or Web traffic is required to route through an on-premises proxy, a “local” Web browser can be 
configured to do so. Direct Internet routing also can be forced back through on-premises gateways by defining 
the next hop via a static route in the vCloud Air vCloud Networking and Security Edge gateway and removing  
the appropriate firewall and SNAT rules. The advanced networking capabilities of the vCloud Networking and 
Security Edge gateway are flexible enough to create the chosen solution, based on a wide variety of requirements.  
In some cases, experimentation with the various options and capabilities might be necessary.

2.3 Deploy Directory and DNS Services
At this point, we have a functional virtual data center inside vCloud Air that is connected to an on-premises data 
center. Firewall rules and a VPN connection have been created and configured, but a potential missing component 
is	a	Microsoft	Active	Directory	or	other	directory	service,	as	well	as	some	basic	infrastructure	services	such	as	
DNS.	For	this	case	study,	it	is	assumed	that	deployed	workloads	will	be	net	new	and	Microsoft	Windows	based;	
therefore,	this	environment	should	be	treated	as	a	new	Active	Directory	“site.”	A	Windows	template	from	the	
global catalog can be chosen and configured to meet the required specifications for a domain controller, or a 
custom template can be uploaded and deployed. 

T E C H N I C A L  W H I T E  p A p E R  /   7

VMware vCloud Air

At a minimum, the following operations should be completed or taken into consideration:

•	Deploy	redundant	virtual	domain	controllers.

 –

Join an existing corporate, secondary, or tertiary domain.

•	Configure	a	new	Active	Directory	“site.”

 –

Add	vCloud	networks	to	Active	Directory	“Sites	and	Services”	and	assign	to	the	new	“site.”

•	Edit	vCloud	network	settings	to	use	the	new	domain	controllers	for	DNS	instead	of	the	vCloud	Networking	 

and Security Edge gateway.

Previously	when	the	vCloud	networks	were	configured,	the	DNS	was	set	to	use	the	vCloud	Networking	and	
Security	Edge	gateway	itself.	Now	that	Active	Directory	and	DNS	are	deployed	in	the	cloud,	changing	this	to	
represent the local servers, as shown in Figure 5, is advised. This will enable new virtual machines deployed  
in the cloud to reflect the updated settings without the need to reconfigure this for each new virtual machine 
upon deployment.

Figure 3. Configured IPsec VPN in vCloud Air

If	DHCP	is	configured	on	the	vCloud	Networking	and	Security	Edge	gateway	for	any	network	segment,	changing	
this	option	on	each	vCloud	network	applies	to	all	DHCP	requests	handled	by	this	edge	gateway.

2.4 Migrate Templates and Virtual Machines
At this point, a decision can be made to identify the templates that can be migrated from the on-premises 
vSphere	environment	to	the	vCloud	Air	private	catalog.	Leveraging	VMware	vCloud	Connector®makes	the	
manual migration process easy, but it might be worthwhile to leverage the catalog sync feature to automate  
the synchronization and migration of templates between this catalog, other VMware infrastructure–based 
clouds and the on-premises data center. 

vCloud Connector also can easily migrate existing virtual machines to vCloud Air with minimal changes,  
if any, to the guest operating system. If it is required to maintain the existing IP and MAC addresses of a  
virtual machine, the data center extension feature can be employed for this purpose. In most cases, however,  
an application can survive an IP and MAC address change.

VMware vCloud Connector documentation can be referred to for more information on specific features and setup 
instructions for the vCloud Connector server and nodes. vCloud Air provides a node that is preconfigured, eliminating 
the need to manually deploy and configure one in this environment. To securely communicate with the nodes in 
each cloud, the vCloud Connector server must be deployed on premises with access to the Internet.

NOTE: Although it is not discussed here, each individual organization must understand and comply with Windows 
server license portability. Due to the nature of Windows License Mobility conditions, the ability of organizations to 
bring their own licenses is currently available only in the vCloud Air Dedicated Cloud offering of vCloud Air.

Conclusion
Providing the basic networking and infrastructure services that a physical data center typically requires is  
the foundation of building an outsourced data center. The remarkable difference between configuring these 
software-defined infrastructure and services versus the traditional model is that it can be done in hours with 
VMware vCloud Air rather than in months or days using conventional means. Further, new levels of business  
and IT agility can be achieved due to the decoupling of the infrastructure layer from the application. After these 
tasks have been completed, the pool of resources can be rapidly and reliably leveraged to deploy new and 
migrate existing workloads with ease.
