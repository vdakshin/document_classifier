Why Choose VMware vSphere 5 for VDI?Overview 

Today, Virtualization Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a key initiative for many organizations looking to reduce  
administrative overhead while providing a more secure, flexible and reliable desktop computing environment 
for end users. Proper planning and good decision making are required to ensure a successful deployment. 
Choosing the right virtualization platform to host the virtual desktop implementation is often the first major 
decision and— to a large degree— can make or break the entire transformation. Important considerations 
when choosing the best VDI platform include: 

•	Does	the	platform	provide	the	features,	reliability,	and	high	availability	to	meet	the	business	requirements?

•	Is	the	platform	reliable	and	proven?

•	Does	the	platform	provide	a	secure	foundation	for	all	the	virtual	desktops?

•	Can	the	infrastructure	be	standardized	on	the	same	platform	as	the	existing	server	virtualization?

•	How	will	the	choice	made	today	impact	future	migration	to	a	cloud	environment?

•	How	does	the	VDI	platform	choice	impact	options	for	a	VDI	solution?

Based on the above criteria, the best choice for most VDI deployments is vSphere because:

1.  vSphere is the leading virtualization platform and provides unbeatable reliability, high availability, 

business continuity, and fault tolerance.

2.  Customers can standardize on a common cloud infrastructure platform from the desktop through the 

datacenter and to the cloud.

3.    VMware View and vSphere integration maximizes the benefits of the leading virtualization platform  

for VDI.

This paper takes a look at each of these attributes in the context of the unique needs of the VDI market.

Why Choose VMware vSphere 5 for VDI?The Leading Virtualization Platform  
on the Market

VMware pioneered x86 server virtualization over ten years ago and has firmly established vSphere as the 
virtualization industry leader as recognized by customers, press and analysts.

vSphere is the Recognized Virtualization Leader
VMware’s culture of innovation continues to propel virtualization and cloud computing into the future. 
Despite competitors’ best efforts to catch up, vSphere maintains a significant technical lead. Features unique 
to vSphere and the benefits of those features are discussed in detail later in this paper. Regarding VMware, 
InfoWorld stated in 2011: “It’s easy to see that VMware has the best, most feature-rich solution on the market. 
It’s years ahead of the competition in many ways and will likely continue to lead the field for many years to 
come.” Competitors often claim that recent or future product releases have “caught up” to VMware or are “near 
parity” with VMware solutions—in reality, what they have actually accomplished is to deliver a first-generation 
feature that allows them to check a box. In contrast, VMware has gone on to develop the second, third, and 
fourth generations of these features. With VMware vSphere 5.0, VMware has raised the bar even higher with 
enhancements that will retain vSphere’s status as the best virtualization platform available. Gartner has placed 
VMware in the leaders’ quadrant of its x86 Virtualization Magic Quadrant, and VMware is the only vendor to 
receive that ranking each year.

vSphere is the Most Proven, Trusted, and Widely Deployed Platform
VMware virtualization solutions are built on a robust foundation proven in production environments and chosen 
by over 250,000 customers, including: 

•	100%	of	Fortune	100

•	100%	of	Fortune	Global	100

•	99%	of	Fortune	1000

•	97%	of	Fortune	Global	500

Among the world’s leading Fortune 1000 companies, VMware has been adopted across all industries, including:

•	100%	of	manufacturers

•	100%	of	healthcare	companies

•	100%	of	technology	companies

•	100%	of	retailers

•	100%	of	transportation	companies

•	97%	of	financial	services	companies

•	95%	of	telecommunications/media/entertainment	companies

Over	94	percent	of	ESX	and	ESXi	deployments	are	in	production	environments—an	example	of	how	both	large 	
and small companies trust VMware for their business-critical workloads.

Why Choose VMware vSphere 5 for VDI?vSphere Is Supported by the Largest Ecosystem
VMware	works	closely	with	its	large	ecosystem	of	partners	(software	vendors,	system	OEMs,	and	peripheral 	
manufacturers) to certify their products with the VMware vSphere platform—usually requiring and delivering 
product certifications when first released. Working with such a wide variety of technology vendors means 
that VMware technology works across the broadest array of IT environments. VMware vSphere supports 
more guest operating systems than any other x86 virtualization platform; in fact, it supports more versions 
of	Windows	than	Microsoft.	VMware’s	hardware	compatibility	list	(HCL)	includes	more	than	2000	servers, 	
1500	storage	devices,	800	storage	controllers,	and	450	network	I/O	cards—more	than	any	of	its	competitors. 	
VMware has also worked with a broad set of software partners to help ensure that vSphere is compatible 
with other software and that other applications will run on vSphere. There are over 1600 ISV partners with 
over 3000 applications qualified to run on vSphere. In a highly virtualized environment, management can be 
complex—for this reason, VMware maintains the industry’s largest ecosystem of virtualization management 
vendors. Our management partners typically support vSphere first which provides customers with the most 
choice	and	flexibility	in	selecting	hardware,	application,	and	management	components	that	best	suit	their	cost/
performance needs while leveraging their existing technology investments.

vSphere Provides the Best Security for Virtual Environments
Highly	virtualized	environments	introduce	new	security	challenges	that	traditional	security	solutions	cannot 	
address on their own. VMware, with the vShield family of products, offers a better approach to security than 
other virtualization vendors. VMware vSphere provides virtualization-aware security and compliance features 
that work with existing solutions to enable adaptive and cost-effective protection within a single management 
framework. VMware’s new security model is the foundation for trusted and scalable virtual infrastructures. 

Standardize on a Common Cloud  
Infrastructure Platform 

Server virtualization reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) by reducing the number of physical servers  
requiring less cooling and less power—at the same time increasing flexibility, agility, and resilience. The majority 
of customers have realized these benefits by using VMware vSphere, and now want to extend these benefits 
achieved with server virtualization to the desktop environment. In the future, they may want to embrace cloud 
computing, and move all applications and data to the cloud. Choosing the right platform for these initiatives 
is a very important investment. The good news is that the best server virtualization platform makes the best 
desktop virtualization platform and the best cloud platform—vSphere. By hosting VDI on vSphere, customers 
have the opportunity to standardize on a common infrastructure platform by leveraging their investment in 
vSphere. When customers are ready to move to the cloud, they can again take advantage of the complete 
cloud stack built on top of vSphere. Choosing vSphere as the VDI platform gives customers the opportunity to 
standardize on a common cloud infrastructure platform from the desktop through the datacenter and to the 
cloud. In contrast, mixed environments often result in more management complexity and higher operation cost.

Why Choose VMware vSphere 5 for VDI?Maximizes the Benefits of Desktop 
Virtualization with VMware View

VMware vSphere supports most of the major VDI solutions, including the market leader, VMware View. VMware 
View as the VDI solution deployed on vSphere maximizes the benefits of vSphere as the VDI platform for the 
following reasons:

•	View	leads	in	integration	with	new	vSphere	capabilities	as	they	are	introduced.	At	VMware,	R&D	teams	for 	
both View and vSphere work closely together to make sure that View takes full advantage of vSphere’s new 
capabilities as soon as they become available. Other VDI vendors typically become certified for new vSphere 
releases at a much later time.

•	View	can	directly	leverage	advanced	features	provided	by	vSphere.	VMware	vSphere	5.0	introduced	fully 	
virtualized 3D graphics—a graphics solution that does not require any additional hardware on the host side. 
View 5.0 quickly took advantage of this feature to expand the use cases for VDI by enabling support for basic 
3D applications such as Windows Aero and Office 2010 with no additional hardware cost. 

•	Built	on	the	vSphere	vShield	technology,	vShield	Endpoint	for	View	is	the	only	solution	that	offloads	antivirus 	
and antimalware agent processing to a dedicated secure virtual appliance delivered by VMware partners. 
The solution is designed to leverage existing investments by allowing customers to manage antivirus and 
antimalware policies for virtualized environments with the same management interfaces they use to secure 
physical	environments.	VMware	vShield	Endpoint:

-  Improves consolidation ratios and performance by eliminating antivirus “storms”

-  Streamlines antivirus and antimalware deployment and monitoring in View environments

-  Satisfies compliance and audit requirements through logging of antivirus and antimalware activities

•	With	all	the	great	benefits	described	above,	View	on	vSphere	actually	lowers	the	total	cost	of	VDI,	making	it 	
more	affordable	to	customers.	View	is	the	only	VDI	solution	that	includes	vSphere	Enterprise	Plus	for	Desktop 	
with unlimited vRAM entitlement in all license packages with no additional license cost. Customers do not 
have to spend extra money on the platform if they deploy VMware View on vSphere.

Aggregate resources across many servers 
into shared resource pools. Manage 
resources independent of the physical 
servers that contribute the resources.

Flexible hierarchical organization. 
Organize resource pools hierarchically to 
match available IT resources to the business 
organization. DRS ensures that resource 
utilization is maximized while business units 
retain control and autonomy of their 
infrastructure. Resource pools can be 
flexibly added, removed, or reorganized as 
business needs or organization change.

Isolation between resource pools. Make 
allocation changes within a resource pool 
without impacting other unrelated resource 
pools. For example, any allocation changes 
in the resource pool dedicated to a given 
business unit do not impact other resource 
pools.

Rich port policies and easy configuration. 
Allow specification of all information 
needed to enable a port: NIC teaming policy, 
VLAN	tagging,	Layer	2	security,	and	traffic	
shaping. Allow configuration of multiple 
virtual ports as a group.

Load-based teaming. Allow dynamic 
adjustment of the teaming algorithm so that 
the load is always balanced across a team of 
physical adapters on a vNetwork Distributed 
Switch.

Network vMotion. Retain network runtime 
state centrally as virtual machines live 
migrate from server to server in shared DRS 
clusters; simplifying network 
troubleshooting and monitoring.

Third-party distributed virtual switches. 
Enable	monitoring	and	control	of	virtual
