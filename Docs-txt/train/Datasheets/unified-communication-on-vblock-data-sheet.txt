ON VBLOCKTM SYSTEMS  

 
VCE designs and delivers VblockTM Systems, the world’s most advanced converged infrastructure—one that optimizes infrastructure, 
lowers costs, secures the environment, speeds deployment, and promotes innovation. And with best-in-class components, one 
architecture spanning the whole portfolio, advanced operations management for converged infrastructure, a single point of contact 
from initiation through support, and the industry's most robust range of configurations and models, the Vblock Systems family 
addresses the unique needs and requirements of practically any size organization, a variety of price points, and a multitude of 
specific verticals and business drivers. 

This document provides an overview of Unified Communications (UC) on Vblock Systems. Optimized for Cisco(R) Unified 
Communications (UC) applications, the solution brings together a comprehensive, integrated IP communications system of voice, 
messaging, video, and desktop applications, with the pre-engineered, pre-integrated, validated Vblock Systems.  

The solution eliminates the need to build an infrastructure from individual vendors -- a non-trivial undertaking when architecture 
design, deployment, and operational complexities are huge. Vblock Systems provide the ability to seamlessly scale Unified 
Communications (UC) up and out as needed using standard compute, network, and storage building blocks. UC, deployed on Vblock 
Systems, enables companies to adapt quickly to market changes, increase productivity, improve their competitive advantage, and 
deliver a rich media experience across any workspace.

Performance Benefits from Vblock Systems
During testing of the Vblock Systems for Unified Communications, VCE demonstrated several benefits of running Cisco UC 
on Vblock Systems.  This was particularly true in the storage domain.  As the number of users supported by the UC 
applications increases, the cache and automated tiering functionality of the EMC VNX array provides increasing value 
compared to traditional storage methods. 

In a scenario to support a 30,000-user UC implementation and requiring approximately 2,200 IOPS, we compared a Vblock 
System using a VCE-optimized FAST VP configuration to a traditional RAID configuration and observed the following 
results:

The FAST VP solution contained within the Vblock System yields a 75% reduction in the number of data drives required to 
implement Cisco UC applications.  

The Vblock System offers balanced CPU, I/O bandwidth, and storage performance and capacity relative to the compute 
and storage arrays in the system.  All components incorporate redundancy into the design.
