COLLABORATION  
 
VCE designs and delivers Vblock™ Systems, which seamlessly integrate leading compute, network and storage technologies. 
Through intelligent discovery, awareness and automation, Vblock Systems provide the highest levels of virtualization and application 
performance. Vblock Systems are unique in their ability to be managed as a single entity with a common interface that provides 
customer choice. 

Service Providers (SPs) need to differentiate their cloud services in a highly competitive market. Meeting the growing demand for 
unified communication and collaboration services is one way to do this, but SPs need a comprehensive, flexible, and agile way to 
provide these services to their customers.  
Vblock Systems for Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) makes Cisco® Unified Communications (UC) and Collaboration applications 
and capabilities available in a hosted environment. Vblock Systems provide standardized units of best-of-breed IT infrastructure that 
can be managed as a single entity and easily scaled as a cohesive, multi-tenant system. This allows SPs to create unified, 
standardized, subscription-based “as-a-service” packages of UC applications using Cisco HCS. 

A comprehensive cloud-based HCS service allows enterprises to focus on their core competencies, while SPs address the growing 
market demand to deliver rich media services—on any device, anywhere.

Sizing Guidelines 
Every deployment of the Vblock Systems for Hosted Collaboration Solution must be sized appropriately for the number of 
subscribers and endpoints that the SP intends to support. Sizing is dependent on a range of parameters including: 
customer profiles and mix, service mix, endpoints, data centers, blade types, CPU cores, RAM, and growth projections. 
Using mid-range assumptions for these parameters, the Cisco HCS Advisor Tool provides the following sizing guidelines:
