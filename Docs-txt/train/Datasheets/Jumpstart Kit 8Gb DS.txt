VirtualWisdom® Jumpstart Kit 

As  a  member  of  the  Virtual  Instruments’  VirtualWisdom  solutions  family,  the  Jumpstart  Kit  is 
designed  to  provide  all  of  the  features  and  benefits  of  VirtualWisdom  and  SANInsight®-based 
instrumentation,  monitoring,  and  measurement 
in  an  entry-level,  standard  deployment 
configuration.   

VirtualWisdom products and services provide comprehensive, real-time instrumentation 
and measurement that allow IT managers to optimize the performance, utilization, and 
availability of their SAN (Storage Area Network) infrastructure.  Strong I/O performance 
is the most critical component of superior application performance. The key to achieving 
strong I/O performance is deploying instrumentation technology that directly measures 
what is going on at a deep level in the transaction workflow, from the host to storage 
array. 

For  SAN  managers,  VirtualWisdom  provides  comprehensive  instrumentation  and  SAN 
I/O  measurement  capabilities  that  reduce  application  response  time, 
increase 
availability, and improve resource utilization. VirtualWisdom is the only product that can 
non-intrusively  improve  the  performance  of  applications  and  increase  the  benefits  of 
storage virtualization in real time by analyzing actual SAN I/O traffic data.  

VirtualWisdom Jumpstart Kit Components 

VirtualWisdom SAN Availability ProbeSW 
ProbeSW is a virtual software probe that collects status from SAN switches via SNMP. 
ProbeSWs collect metrics for each port, and these metrics are generated and reported 
to the VirtualWisdom Server by each ProbeSW. Each ProbeSW monitors all ports of a 
particular  fibre-channel  switch  and  collects  the  metrics  for  each  port,  such  as  the 
number of frames and bytes transmitted, as well as the key faults for each port, such as 
loss of synchronization, link resets, link failures, packet discards, and CRC errors. 
 
VirtualWisdom Server 
VirtualWisdom  Portal  Server  software  resides  on  your  Windows  server  platform, 
controlling  and  collecting  metrics  from  probes.  It  manages  the  database  of  metrics, 
handles integration with third party products via SNMP traps, and handles alerting. The 
VirtualWisdom Portal Server co-resides with the ProbeSW software.

VirtualWisdom Dashboard and Views  
VirtualWisdom Dashboard software is a real-time summary display that 
provides an overview of the virtual and physical infrastructure performance and 
faults, based on the metrics available from the probes. It displays the key 
activity related to servers and storage including measurements for percent 
utilization, reads, writes, events, alarms, as well as signal and error status on 
the probe channels.  VirtualWisdom Views software allows users to access the 
VirtualWisdom SAN metrics and alerts from their workstations in the form of 
reports, graphs, and tables, in either real-time or via historical trends.  

VirtualWisdom SAN Performance ProbeFC8  
Fibre-Channel probes (ProbeFC8s) analyze every frame header on a fibre-
channel SAN at line rates up to 8 Gbits per second. ProbeFC8 probes detect 
application performance slowdowns and transmission errors by measuring 
every SCSI I/O transaction in real-time from start to finish, for every 
server/volume combination (initiator/target/ LUN).  

SANInsight™ TAP Patch Panel System 
Traffic Access Points (TAPs) provide a passive, fail-safe access point to fibre-
channel network traffic on a SAN for failure analysis, problem diagnosis, and 
performance monitoring. TAPs operate “out-of-band” by transparently 
diverting a portion of the signal through the TAP to another port, which 
provides a copy of the Fibre Channel frame headers. The agent-less TAP has 
no impact on application or SAN performance.  

SANInsight™ 8GFC Rover  
The Rover physical layer switch extends the monitoring reach of each 
ProbeFC8 probe to groups of SAN links. ProbeFC8 probes and protocol 
analyzers can be attached to Rover physical layer switches and access any of 
the connected SAN links. Rovers provide a way to deploy a tiered monitoring 
architecture to lower the cost of monitoring and extend the investment in 
VirtualWisdom.  

VirtualWisdom QuickStart Installation & Training Service 
QuickStart Service is designed to jumpstart the deployment of Virtual Instruments’ VirtualWisdom and SANInsight 
products such as Traffic Access Points (TAPs), SAN monitoring probes (ProbeFC8, ProbeSW), and Rovers. These 
services combine on-site training, deployment and baseline assessment services to help ensure a successful initial 
VirtualWisdom deployment.
