Service Assurance and Service Level Agreements 

Growing expectations for application delivery and business continuity has placed increasingly rigorous 
demands upon service providers to deliver reliable, cost-efficient SLAs to IT corporations. While many of 
these high-technology industries now turn to service providers for data center support, meeting these SLAs 
depends solely on the quality of the infrastructure platform. Today’s IT corporations work under a more 
demanding set of prerequisites, including operating applications in a scalable, flexible multitenant 
environment, supporting highly extensible workloads, and maintaining consistency and predictability of 
application performance under adverse conditions. 

IT corporations have become wary of the effects of migrating data center operations into a cloud-computing 
model, particularly when it pertains to costs of such a transitional endeavor. Corporations need to consider 
the capital expenditures (CAPEX) of transitioning into a new IT infrastructure, as the uncertainties of both 
the long and short-term effects can hamper adoption. Also factoring into the equation are operating 
expenses (OPEX) stemming from powering and cooling of high-density equipment, as well as the staff 
requirements for maintaining such duties. 

Additional questions may hamper an organization’s decision to move its data center needs and application 
operations into the cloud. For instance, it is imperative for applications to comply to the same regulatory 
requirements as in a typical IT environment. Organizations must bank on the same quality of service (QoS) 
in a cloud-computing environment as in a traditional IT setting. Corporations expect the same level of 
security measures enforced in the cloud. 

Customer demands for a more intricate, sophisticated SLA require improvements in the infrastructure 
platform in nearly every facet. While IT customers once emphasized service availability as the cornerstone 
of an SLA, agreements now focus on quality network performance as the primary Key Performance Indicator 
(KPI).  

Quality SLAs are comprised of such components as establishing segmentation in the marketplace, providing 
simple service deployments, controlling rising costs, and managing ever-changing customer demand.

Establishing Market Segmentation 

Segmentation within a market has become a common practice for corporations seeking to make an impact 
with sales production. However, a successful market segmentation endeavor can often result in hefty 
increases in sales expenditures, as it establishes clear differentiators with market competitors. In order to 
appeal to a targeted demographic, the marketing campaign must identify the potential consumer’s 
requirements and impending needs, prerequisites that are generally outlined in an SLA. These customer 
requirements often include:  

•  Cost reduction 
•  Productivity increases 
• 
Improve service quality 
•  Greater profitability 
•  Supporting highly extensible workloads 

Providing Service Deployment Satisfaction 

Deployment complexities can often hamper an organization’s commitment to migrating into a new IT 
environment. Successful service deployments often require an intricate, convoluted process that involves 
intense planning, increased manpower, and an extended integration of application resources. When 
deploying into a new IT environment, organizations need affirmation that security, integrity, and efficiency 
will not be compromised during the process. The reluctance of many major enterprises to shift into a cloud-
computing community stems directly from the ambiguity of the deployment process. 

Controlling Rising Costs 

The hefty cost of support and maintenance is another obstacle that service providers contend with when 
wooing major corporations into cloud computing. Nearly every organization today is targeting cost savings 
as a leading priority in their business ventures. However, the financial demands placed on staffing, IT 
maintenance, and operating equipment can be stifling. Growth and expansion has become increasingly 
difficult for companies seeking to expand data center capacities while fully utilizing network and computing 
resources. In essence, the ability to lower capital and operational expenditures has become highly elusive in 
today’s challenging marketplace.  

Managing Unpredictable Demand 

Varying utilization among customers increases the need to ensure data availability for enterprises 
considering a leap into virtualized infrastructure solutions. With demand levels that consistently fluctuate, IT 
corporations prefer a flexible, scalable infrastructure for handling unpredictable workloads.

combine management, storage, and virtualization software in one all-encompassing package. 

Vblock platforms provide the vital ingredients for affirming quality assurance with customers contemplating a 
move into the world of cloud computing. These essentials include: 

Trusted Multi-Tenancy (TMT) model 

• 
•  Workload mobility 
•  Services 

Trusted Multi-Tenancy 

The VCE Trusted Multi-Tenancy (TMT) model is an integral part of Vblock platforms as it provides 
component isolation and dynamic resource allocation through its six elements. With the cohesiveness of 
several major hardware and software components, the VCE TMT model incorporates numerous valuable 
services, including: 

•  Security of virtual machines in each layer of the TMT stack 
•  Acceleration of application traffic from the cloud-hosting data center 
•  Optimization of the wide area network (WAN) 
•  Monitoring and reporting of application performance over the WAN to various locations 

Figure 2. Six Elements of Trusted Multi-Tenancy 

 

One component is Service Assurance, a critical means for establishing customer satisfaction among various 
tenants in the cloud environment. While the scalable resources within a virtualized platform are constantly 
allocated and reallocated, multi-tenancy allows the service provider to conform to the customer’s ever-
changing business needs, delivering the same level of maintenance outlined in an SLA.

Secure Separation 

Perhaps the most integral part of multi-tenancy in a virtualized environment is secure separation, the 
successful segregation of the various tenants and their respective assets. Effective secure separation is one 
in which each tenant can access only the resources existing within their ownership. It is assured that these 
resources remain uninhabited, whereas the workloads, data pools, and various applications remain 
separated from other new tenants being provisioned. Methods of secure separation include network, 
compute, storage, and application infrastructure layers.  

Service Assurance 

The level of service guaranteed to a customer is a vital component of TMT operations, and the inability to 
deliver reliable performance hampers the process of providing quality SLAs. With the constant evolution of 
workloads, compliance protocols, and application requirements, it is critical to maintain high service levels to 
uphold customer relationships. Providers must be able to conform to a customer’s dynamic needs, as a 
consistent, predictable delivery of service is highly essential. Providing top-quality service and maintaining 
solid cost models are the keys to effective service assurance. 

Security and Compliance 

A leading concern of providers and tenants in a TMT environment is the guarantee of security and 
compliance within each layer of the TMT stack. Utilizing such tools as firewalls, malware protection, 
encryption and key management, intrusion prevention, and identity management and access control, the 
security and compliance of this solution preserves the confidentiality of the tenant’s resources. The tenant’s 
daily activities are continuously verified and monitored, as are all the provisioning, management, and 
configuration activities performed within the environment. With the dynamic nature of regulatory compliance, 
operating on a cloud requires increased subjection to security and compliance standards. 

Availability and Data Protection 

In the multi-tenant environment, not only must sufficient data storage, memory, bandwidth and memory be 
accessible to the tenant, they must also remain protected at all times. Data protection addresses a tenant’s 
concern of remaining secure in a cloud-computing environment, where emphasis is often placed upon high 
performance levels. With the guarantee of solid data protection, enterprises may identify the more critical 
items in regards to reducing costs and maintaining a solid procedure for preventing data loss.  

Tenant Management and Control 

Another facet of TMT is the rendering of management and control to tenants within the environment, 
allowing them to maintain security, compliance, and budding revenue opportunities. Maintaining control over 
important aspects of their individual services, tenants can maintain administrative contacts, modify a 
management status for various elements of the infrastructure, determine the direction of virtualized objects, 
and provision allocated resources. With delegated control and management capabilities, tenants can remain 
on top of the existing data within the multi-tenancy environment while conforming to workloads that change 
according to varying resource requirements. 

Service Provider Management and Control 

The final tier of the TMT model allots appropriate levels of management and control to the providers of 
infrastructure services. Challenges are often presented when managing a multi-tenancy environment, 
including the proper delegation of control among various tenants, handling reporting issues, and distributing 
capacity alerts. Therefore, full visibility of the shared environment is imperative for service providers to 
furnish tenants with security, data protection, availability, and necessary service levels. The Vblock platforms 
thereby provide integrated management solutions that are both scalable and flexible, allowing a 
comprehensive application performance interface (API) stack to enhance service value.

Workload Mobility 

A key essential to the delivery of service assurance is workload availability and mobility. In order to supply 
first-class services, providers must be able to effectively and flexibly scale a variety of workloads in a cloud 
environment in a cost-efficient manner. With workload mobility, service providers can overcome limits placed 
on high volumes of virtual machines and connections that can be supported among large enterprise 
customers.  

Often times, server failures and data center issues result in service interruptions. Therefore, the ability to 
deploy virtual machines from one server to another without nagging interruptions is an invaluable benefit for 
any IT organization. Likewise, the mobility of virtual workloads between data centers is paramount in 
averting disasters. Workload mobility not only prevents interruptions during such transfers, it also allows you 
to locate the ideal path for virtual private network (VPN) connections, accommodating users migrating to 
data centers with available resources.  

This capability afforded to customers of supporting high numbers of virtual machines ensures capacity for 
future demand spikes and business growth. Hence, the availability and mobility of a virtualized workload 
provides tremendous leverage for service providers determined to produce exceptional SLAs. Figure 3 
illustrates the mobility of workloads between data centers supported by Vblock platforms. 

Additional benefits of workload mobility include: 

•  Migration to an additional data center deflects issues with power, cooling, capacity, and space 

constraints in the primary location. 

•  Applications migrated from a data center requiring maintenance eliminates downtime. 
• 

Load balancing can be performed across multiple sites when virtual environments are extended 
between data centers.
