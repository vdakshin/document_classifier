Certificate Revocation Checking Using  
OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

Introduction

About VMware View
VMware® View™ is a best-in-class enterprise desktop virtualization platform. VMware View solution separates 
the personal desktop environment from the physical system by moving desktops to a datacenter, and then 
accessing the desktops using a client-server computing model. VMware View satisfies a rich set of features 
required for any enterprise deployment by providing a robust platform for hosting virtual desktops from 
VMware vSphere™. Additional capabilities such as distributed infrastructure services and virtual desktop failover 
and recovery make it an ideal solution for desktop virtualization.

VMware View provides different authentication mechanisms such as username-password, smart card or RSA, 
along with further enhancements like single sign-on (SSO) and Triple SSO. With VMware View 4.5/4.6, smart 
card authentication has additional manageability with the introduction of OCSP and CRL features. This paper 
provides a technical overview of these features, in addition to the specific configurations required in common 
implementations. Overall, this paper covers:

•	 A	brief	discussion	of	smart	card	certificate	authentication

•	 A	brief	discussion	of		OCSP	and	CRL	features

•	 VMware	View	integration	with	OCSP	and	CRL

•	 Some	tips	and	tricks

•	 Basic	troubleshooting

About Smart Card Certificate Authentication
Smart card certificate authentication is used by many enterprises as a security measure. Smart card 
authentication is a widely used two-factor authentication (TFA) mechanism. Common implementations of 
two-factor authentication use ‘something you know’ as one of the two factors, and ‘something you have’ as the 
other factor. A common example of TFA is a debit card, where the card itself is the physical item you have, and 
the personal identification number (PIN) is something you know that is associated with it.

Smart Card Authentication Infrastructure Requirements
The following prerequisites should be appropriately configured for successful smart card authentication:

•	 Certificate	Authority	–	Managed	within	the	enterprise	(for	example,	Microsoft	Certificate	Authority)	or	by	a 	

trusted external Certificate Authority (for example, VeriSign).

- Configure the Certificate Authority (CA) to issue the proper certificates.

- Specify policy that dictates which users can enroll for those certificates.

•	 Enrollment	Agent	–	This	role	should	be	configured	in	a	CA	or	on	a	dedicated	system.	This	role	is	required	for 	

registering user certificates to a smart card. 

•	 Smart	Card	–	Generally,	a	plastic	card	with	embedded	integrated	circuits	(for	example,	an	employee	ID	card).

•	 Smart	Card	Reader	–	A	communication	medium	between	the	smart	card	and	the	host.

•	 Cryptographic	Service	Provider	(CSP)	drivers	–	An	interface	to	the	smart	card	(for	example,	Microsoft	CSP).

For further information on enrolling user certificates on to smart cards, refer to a Microsoft online resource: 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc736901%28WS.10%29.aspx.

Certificate Revocation Checking Using  
OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

Revocation Overview
Generally,	certificates	are	issued	for	a	defined	period	and	configured	with	validity	parameters	that	include	start 	
time and an explicit expiration date. This effectively means the certificate can be issued with a validity of one 
day, one year or several years. Once issued, a certificate becomes valid from the beginning of its validity time, 
and it is considered valid until its expiration date is reached. Apart from this, there can be different scenarios 
which cause a certificate to become invalid prior to expiration. Certificates are often revoked when a user leaves 
an organization, loses a smart card, or moves from one department to another.

To enable revocation, RFC 5280 lists the following states that can be applied by a CA to any of its issued 
certificates.

 There are two popular certificate validation mechanisms:

•	 CRL	–	Certificate	Revocation	List

•	 OCSP	–	Online	Certificate	Status	Protocol	

Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a digitally signed list issued by a CA that contains certificates that have 
been revoked. The list includes the serial number of the certificate, the date certificate was revoked, and the 
reason for revocation. VMware View Connection Server can perform CRL checking to determine a presented 
certificate’s revocation status. There are two variants of CRL:

•	 Base/Full	CRL:	A	type	of	CRL	that	contains	a	list	of	certificates	revoked	and	published	automatically	in 	

specified intervals as defined by the administrator of CA.

•	 Delta	CRL:	A	type	of	CRL	that	contains	a	list	of	certificates	revoked	since	the	last	base/full	CRL	was	published.

OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) supplements CRL validation, and enables high-performance 
validation of certificate status. Further, an OCSP server can retrieve the CRLs from all CAs in an organization. 
Upon implementation, an organization can use an OCSP server as a single point of contact for revocation 
validation. This enables client applications to obtain timely information on the revocation status of a certificate. 

An OCSP server works using a Responder-Repeater configuration. Typically, an enterprise would configure a 
single OCSP Responder and multiple OCSP Repeaters.

Configuring VMware View for Certificate 
authentication and Revocation Checking

Configuring VMware View for Smart Card Authentication
The following steps are required for smart card authentication in VMware View:

•	 Obtain	a	root	certificate	from	the	CA

•	 Create	a	trust	store	using	the	keytool

•	 Create	a	locked.properties file with appropriate attributes
For further details regarding the configuration of smart card authentication with respect to VMware View, refer 
to VMware VMware View 4.5/4.6 Administrator’s Guide.

Using/Configuring Certificate Revocation Checking in VMware View
VMware View supports revocation checking with CRLs as well as OCSP in environments with VMware 
Connection	Server	and	VMware	Security	Server.	Both	CRL	and	OCSP	features	can	be	configured	on	a	single 	
server (standard, replica, security) instance. When both types of certificate revocation checking mechanism 
are configured, VMware View attempts to use OCSP first, and falls back to the CRL. However, please note that 
VMware View does not fall back to OCSP if the CRL fails. 

For further details regarding the configuration of CRLs and OCSPs with respect to VMware View, refer to the 
VMware View 4.5/4.6 Administrator’s Guide.

Certificate Revocation Checking Using  
OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

Revocation Checking with CRL
When VMware View is configured for revocation checking with the CRL, the revocation status of a certificate 
is determined by accessing the CRL published by the appropriate CA. If a certificate is found to be revoked, 
ther VMware View client throws an appropriate error: Smart card authentication failed. Please contact your 
Administrator. (Revocation Checks failed). 

When configuring CRL with VMware View, you will need to follow the steps mentioned under the section 
Configuring  Smart Card Authentication. Once you have successfully completed these steps, you will need to 
update the locked.properties file with appropriate attribute values.
The following locked.properties attribute values are mandatory when configuring CRL revocation checking 
in VMware View:

trustKeyfile=lonqa.key
trustStoretype=JKS
useCertAuth=true
enableRevocationChecking=true
crlLocation=http://root.ocsp.net/certEnroll/ocsp-ROOT_CA.crl
Once the above attributes are configured, restart the VMware View Connection Server service for the changes 
to take effect.

Revocation Checking with OCSP
When VMware View is configured for revocation checking with OCSP, the revocation status of a certificate 
is determined by sending a verification request to an OCSP Responder. If a certificate is found to be revoked, 
VMware View client sends an appropriate error message.

TE C H N I C A L W H I T E P A P E R  /   6

Certificate Revocation Checking Using  
OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

The following locked.properties attribute values are mandatory when configuring OCSP revocation 
checking in VMware View:

trustKeyfile=lonqa.key
trustStoretype=JKS
useCertAuth=true
enableRevocationChecking=true
enableOCSP=true
allowCertCRLs=true
ocspSigningCert=te-ca.signing.cer
ocspURL=http://te-ca.lonqa.int/ocsp
You need to place OCSP Responder signing certificates alongside the locked.properties file, and specify 
the name under the attribute ocspSigningCert.
Once you have configured these attributes, restart the VMware View Connection Server service for the changes 
to take effect.

OCSP Update Intervals
A CA publishes CRLs at regular intervals based on the configuration. However, you can configure the OCSP 
Responder to refresh its revocation lists based on either the validity period of the CRL being used, or at a 
manually configured interval. 

Windows 2008 Server can be configured as an OCSP Responder. For detailed instructions on setting up and 
configuring OCSP, refer to the Microsoft TechNet article. 

Revocation Checking With Both CRL and OCSP
You can configure VMware View to use both CRL and OCSP mechanisms together. The following 
locked.properties attribute values are mandatory when configuring both CRL and OCSP revocation 
checking in VMware View:

trustKeyfile=lonqa.key
trustStoretype=JKS
useCertAuth=true
enableRevocationChecking=true
enableOCSP=true
ocspCRLFailover=true
allowCertCRLs=true
ocspSigningCert=te-ca.signing.cer
ocspURL=http://te-ca.lonqa.int/ocsp
crlLocation=http://root.ocsp.net/certEnroll/ocsp-ROOT_CA.crl

Certificate Revocation Checking Using  
OCSP and CRL in VMware View 4.5/4.6

When both CRL and OCSP are configured, OCSP will have higher priority over CRL revocation checking. In 
such a configuration, if OCSP validation fails then VMware View will fall back to CRL validation. This fall back 
mechanism is controlled by the attribute ocspCRLFailover in locked.properties file. Once you configure 
these attributes, restart the VMware View Connection Server service for the changes to take effect.

Figure 2: A pictorial representation of VMware View integration with OCSP Responder

The VMware View administration interface provides various options for smart card authentication. These are: 

•	 Optional	–	If	smart card authentication is set to optional, the user is allowed to login using username/

password on smart card authentication failure.

•	 Required	–	If	smart card authentication is set to required, the user is NOT allowed to login using username/

password on smart card authentication failure.

•	 Not	allowed	–	If	smart card authentication is set to not allowed, the user is NOT allowed to login using a 

smart card.

The figure below illustrates these options:

OCSP/CRL Revocation Checking with Local Mode
In Local Mode, Revocation checking is performed only if VMware View Client can communicate with VMware 
View Connection Server

Certificate revocation checking is performed as in a normal remote session.

•	 User	Certificate	is	unrevoked.	If	the	user	certificate	is	not	revoked,	the	authentication	succeeds. 	

•	 User	Certificate	is	revoked.	If	the	user	certificate	is	revoked,	the	authentication	fails.

Tips and Tricks

Cross-forest Certificate Enrollment With Windows Server 2008
Traditionally, an enterprise CA is limited to issuing certificates only to the clients that belong to the same Active 
Directory	(AD)	forest.	This	means	that	user	and	client	computers	would	only	attempt	to	enroll	certificates	from 	
a CA in the local forest, especially in auto-enrollment scenarios. Further, this drawback forces administrators to 
have at least one CA per forest.

Starting with Windows Server 2008 R2, this barrier is removed by supporting cross-forest certificate enrollment. 
This	feature	enables	clients	to	enroll	a	certificate	from	a	CA	of	a	different	AD	forest,	further	reducing	the 	
number of CAs in a multiforest environment.

For further details regarding the cross-forest certificate enrollment, refer to the Microsoft white paper Cross-
forest Certificate Enrollment with Windows Server 2008 R2.

Configuring VMware View to Use HTTP Proxy
If a proxy server is not configured in a company’s 
environment, this step can be safely skipped.

There are instances where enterprises would have 
revocation-checking mechanisms placed outside a 
company’s internal network. In such cases, the VMware 
View Connection Server needs to contact an entity outside 
the internal network. If the company has a policy to 
direct Internet traffic through a proxy, then VMware View 
Connection Server requires additional configuration to 
contact the OCSP Responder. This is because the VMware 
View Server uses a Java socket that doesn’t depend on 
Internet	Explorer	proxy	settings.

You can use the following steps to configure the VMware 
View Java socket layer to use a proxy for HTTPS requests. 
This enables the VMware View Server to contact the OCSP 
Responder.

•		Open	the	Registry	Hive	

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VMware, Inc.\
VMware VDM\plugins\wsnm\TunnelService\Params
•		Configure	Dhttp.proxyHost and  
 Dhttp.proxyPort keys. 
   For example:  

  Dhttp.proxyHost=<proxy123> 
  Dhttp.proxyPort=<proxyport>
  Note: These values need to be appended and should  
  not overwrite the previous values.

•		Restart	the	VMware	Connection	Server	Service	for	the 	 
  changes to take effect.
