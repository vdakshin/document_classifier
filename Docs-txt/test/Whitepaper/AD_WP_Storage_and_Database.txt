Storage and Database 
Collaboration

IT organizations have been divided into different 
groups with distinct realms of control (aka silos) for 
many years. This paradigm has been changing over 
the past few years as a result of increased business 
focus on applications as the driver of revenue, and the 
increased levels of complexity associated with modern 
applications (virtualization, cloud, SOA, etc.).
The change is most evident with the rapidly growing 
DevOps movement, which promotes greater levels 
of collaboration between application developers and 
IT operations personnel. In this white paper we will 
explore the changes that are happening throughout 
IT organizations and explain why it is important for 
database and storage administrators to understand, 
embrace, and participate in this changing paradigm. 
Keep reading so you can take your seat at the table.

An AppDynamics Business White PaperIT Operations is Changing
DevOps may be a buzzword but the philosophy is becoming reality within many 
IT organizations. The high degree of virtualization combined with the capability of 
deploying new infrastructure from code has created a situation where silo’d  teams 
need to collaborate for multiple reasons:

–  Collaboration helps teams deploy faster and fix problems faster

–  Companies following collaborative philosophies like DevOps can innovate and 

respond to change faster

–  Employees that are not able to collaborate will fall out of favor as the rest of the 

company changes

This new paradigm will encompass all groups involved with the delivery of 
application services. Development, system administration, application operations, 
database administration, storage administration, network operations, and any 
other group that plays a part in the creation, deployment, and operation of any 
application will eventually be required to participate.

DevOps Statistics 
ZeroTurnaround surveyed 620 engineers to understand how much time they spend 
carrying out their tasks each week. The results of the study were published on 
devops.com and are very interesting. (http://devops.com/tag/devops-statistics/)
The image below is a list of tasks and associated hours. The black bars represent 
the traditional silo’d environment while the yellow bars represent work done in a 
DevOps oriented environment.

Storage and Database CollaborationThe numbers are impressively in favor of the organizations that have adopted a 
DevOps philosophy. The statistics look really good, but the big challenge is making 
the cultural shift.

So what does this all mean to DBA’s and storage administrators and why am I 
lumping them together?

The Database and Storage Relationship 
Database performance is directly impacted by storage performance, and storage 
performance can be significantly impacted by database workloads. The natural 
side effect of this relationship is finger pointing when performance problems 
appear. Finger pointing is a consequence of working in a silo’d manner. Each 
team is accustomed to using the free or included tools that provide them with 
information only related to their silo’d system (DB, storage, etc.). This further 
compounds the natural response of finger pointing when there are problems that 
are difficult to isolate.

If the storage and database teams can begin to work in a collaborative manner on a 
daily basis they will start to reap the rewards shown in the ZeroTurnaround survey 
— less time fixing problems and more time making improvements.

Turning the Idea Into Reality
Now that we have an understanding of the desired state (a high level of 
collaboration across organizational silos), the question becomes, how do you start 
down a path that leads to the final goal?

Start small and communicate - If you’re a storage admin, reach out to some folks 
on the DBA team and ask if you can be included in their meetings. The same goes 
for the DBA’s; start talking to your storage admins regularly. Don’t get management 
involved and start a big project, that’s too much overhead and too much scrutiny 
to start out with. The key is to quickly increase the quantity and quality of 
communication between teams. There is no need to merge teams, just to create a 
new level of engagement between teams.

Document a small success - Now that you are communicating better, you should 
see an area where this new level of collaboration is making an improvement. 
Remember “show and tell” time when you were in school? The corporate equivalent 
is the “dog and pony show”. Regardless of how you feel about presenting, in order 
to expand this new collaborative paradigm you will need to show off your success to 
peers and management. Document your success (a small presentation of less than 
10 slides will do fine) and be prepared to present it.

is the blending of 
tasks performed by a 
company’s application 
development and 
systems operations 
teams.”

Show your management - At this point you will probably need to get approval 
from your management to increase the reach of your collaborative program. Your 
documentation of success should be used to show management that what you 
are working on is worthwhile. This is the point where you can arrange with your 
manager to spend more time collaborating with other teams to make sure you are 
all working in a coordinated manner.

Engage the community - Hopefully you have permission to engage the larger 
community at this point. Ideally, you can describe your work to the rest of the 
storage and DBA teams and see who takes interest in your new style of working. 
The great part about this stage is that you can reuse the presentation material you 
used with your manager. Be sure to collect the contact information of the people 
who are interested in working in a more collaborative manner and create a group 
where everyone can communicate with each other easily.

Grow your reach - At this point you have influenced the way you and your peers 
work together. Now it’s time to grow your reach beyond just database and storage. 
Reach out to the application and network teams and repeat the same process 
you just used. Invite them to your meetings and ask to be invited to theirs. If you 
can work in a collaborative manner with all of the people involved in delivering an 
application to the end users, you will improve the overall end user experience and 
your documentation will prove the value of your work.

The Role of Software Tools
Software tools should help you achieve a defined goal. Tools should help solve a 
specific problem or set of problems. When you have a goal of a highly collaborative 
environment, you need to have tools that are designed to foster that collaboration.

Responding to production problems is an area where collaboration can produce 
dramatic results. When problems occur, application teams often blame the problem 
on the database. The database team is then tasked with either finding and fixing 
the problem or with proving their innocence. Database performance issues will 
reside within the database server itself or will be a result of slow storage response 
(which might also be a network problem).

The database and storage teams need to quickly understand if there are any 
problems that they need to fix. In order to do that, they need more intelligent 
monitoring tools that collect the proper data before and during the problem so that 
they can compare good performance to poor performance. They also need to see 
the storage and database metrics on the same screen to identify the impact of one 
on the other. See the example screenshots on the following pages.

Storage and Database CollaborationDocumentation using Software Tools
Software tools are also a great way to create impressive and useful documentation. 
When you have tools that continually collect information about your infrastructure 
and applications you can use that information to make better decisions (is it time 
for new hardware?), to justify past decisions (is our new hardware performing the 
way we expected it to?), or to use as a planning tool for decisions that need to be 
made in the future (capacity planning).

Use screenshots from your tools to describe problems and results in a visual 
manner while calling out what the visuals mean. See Figure 6 and Figure 7.

Steps to create meaningful documentation: 
1. Describe the problem 
2. Describe the business impact of the problem 
3. Describe the solution and results

Storage and Database CollaborationConclusion
IT applications, architecture, and operations are in the midst of a fundamental 
shift. With the adoption of virtualization, service oriented architectures, and cloud 
computing environments, collaboration is a requirement for solving problems in 
a fast and effective manner. Organizations that do not collaborate well will spend 
much more time troubleshooting issues instead of improving the quality of their 
service. Ultimately, the organizations that achieve high levels of collaboration 
will innovate faster while providing higher levels of service. These companies will 
take customer share and revenue from their less nimble and more problematic 
competition. Start your collaborative journey now and don’t fall behind your 
competition. Don’t be left without your seat at the table.
