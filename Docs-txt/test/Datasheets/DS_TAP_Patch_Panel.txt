The Challenge: Optimizing Performance, 
Availability & Utilization
A best practices-compliant physical layer must be capable of being both 
maintained  and  monitored  in  order  to  meet  those  demands.  Physical 
layer maintenance requires the ability to quickly and easily add, change, 
or remove links and devices. Physical layer monitoring is the real-time 
acquisition of error, performance, and utilization data via Traffic Access 
Points,  or TAPs.  Monitoring  ensures  the  accuracy  of  the  changes  and 
validates that they produce only the desired results. Physical layers that 
address  both  requirements  enable  the  Fiber  Channel  SANs  operating 
on  top  of  them  to  be  iteratively  optimized  for  maximum  availability, 
performance, and utilization.

Fiber optic cable plants make broad use of patch panels, which simplify 
changing  device  connections  to  pre-installed  cabling,  to  improve 
maintainability.  But  while  the  tremendous  value  of  passive,  out-of-band 
monitoring is increasingly recognized, the deployment of the enabling TAPs 
has not yet reached the same level of ubiquity, due at least in part to the 
low fiber density and limited configurations of pre-existing TAP solutions.

All  too  often, TAP  installation  is  only  undertaken  on  a  retrofit  basis  to 
help troubleshoot  active  problems  in  production  environments. This  is 
a  highly  inefficient  approach,  as  no  matter  how  critical  the  problems, 
TAP  installation  will  require  downtime  or  will  have  to  wait  for  the  next 
scheduled maintenance window

Further, as Tapping is typically undertaken only for those links impacted 
by the current issue, it does little to help either prevent future issues or 
speed their resolution.

Utilization
Virtual Instrument’s new SANInsight TAP Patch Panel System provides a range of options for integrating the unique, 
patented technology of our TAPs into patch panels from both Virtual Instruments and other leading vendors.

By unifying TAPs and patch functions into a single layer of physical infrastructure, SANInsight significantly reduces the 
cost, complexity, and infrastructure impact of TAP deployment. SANInsight facilitates the broad installation of TAPs 
into both new and existing physical infrastructures, fully addressing the best practices monitorability requirement 
and enabling complete SAN optimization.

Solution Components
The TAP Patch Panel System incorporates TAPs into TAP 
Patch Cassettes that are installed into rack-mounted Patch 
Shelves. Each of these components is detailed below.

Traffic Access Point (TAP)

A TAP  uses  a  passive  (unpowered)  fiber  optic  splitter 
to  create  an  exact  copy  of  the  light  signal  passing 
through it. The fiber carrying the signal from a device’s 
transmit  port  is  connected  to  the  splitter  input;  the 
splitter’s live output is connected to the receive port of 
the downstream device, while a second output carries 
the copy of the live signal for out-of-band access. A TAP 
uses two of these splitters, installed on the two fibers 
supporting  both  channels  of  a  duplex  Fiber  Channel 
link, to  create  a  complete  copy  of  all traffic  between 
the two devices.

The ratio at which the splitter divides the incoming light 
signal between the two outputs is called the “split ratio.” 
Virtual Instrument’s standard splitters use a 70/30 ratio 
–70% of the incoming light goes to the live output, 30% 
to the TAP output. Keeping such a high portion of the 
light  on  the  live  output  is  critically  important,  given 
the tight light budgets imposed by high Fiber Channel 
line rates. Apart from the attenuation that results from 
dividing  the  light  signal,  the  splitter  introduces  no 
latency  or  other  alteration  to  the  signal.  Its  behavior 

remains  constant  whether  or  not  a  receiving  device 
is connected to the TAP output, making the TAP a true 
“install and forget” physical layer component.

While the optical splitter is simple in concept, in practice 
there are significant technical challenges to creating a 
jitter-free and fully-readable TAP output, especially when 
combining asymmetrical split ratios and high line speeds. 
Virtual  Instrument’s  TAPs  use  patented  technology  to 
address these challenges and are certified to provide a 
fully readable signal copy up to a 10 Gb/s line rate. Our 
TAP  technology  is  demonstrably  superior  to  products 
that  use  a  symmetrical  50/50  split  ratio,  which  may 
attenuate the live signal to unworkably low levels, or that 
have not addressed the jitter issue and will not produce 
a readable TAP output at higher line rates

TAP Patch Cassette

The TAP Patch Cassette houses the TAPs and provides 
standard  fiber  optic  adapters  for  connecting  the 
trunk,  patch,  and TAP  cabling. The  dimensions  of  the 
standard VI TAP  Patch  Cassette  body  (an  example  is 
shown  in  Figure  2)  allow  it to  mount  in  both VI’s TAP 
Patch  Shelves  and  Panduit’s  OptiCom®  QuickNetTM 

Figure 2: Top Diagram View of Example VI TAP Patch Cassette

enclosures.  TAP  Patch  Cassettes  with  dimensions 
compatible with other patch enclosures or shelves are 
available by special order.

The VI TAP  Patch  Cassette  is  available  in  four  standard 
configurations with varying fiber densities and mixes of 
LC and MT trunk, patch, and TAP connections on the front 
and rear panels. These configurations, shown in detail in 
Figure 3, are as follows:

•   8 live fibers/4 duplex links; front duplex 

LC adapters for trunk, patch, and TAP 
connections. Part # TCV-008DFDFDF-XY.
•   12 live fibers/6 duplex links; rear duplex 
LC adapters for trunk connections; front 
duplex LC adapters for patch and TAP 
connections. Part # TCV-012DRDFDF-XY.

•   12 live fibers/6 duplex links; rear MT 
adapters for trunk connections; front 
duplex LC adapters for patch and TAP 
connections. Part # TCV-012MRDFDF-XY.

•   24 live fibers/12 duplex links; rear MT 

adapters for trunk and TAP connections; 
front duplex LC adapters for patch 
connections. Part # TCV-024MRDFMR-XY.
•   Each of these configurations is available in 

several fiber types and split ratios; these are 
specified in the X and Y characters of the 
part numbers, respectively, as follows:

•   X= 5 for OM3 50µm laser-optimized multi- 
mode fiber; 6 for 62.5µm multi-mode fiber, 
and 9 for 9um single-mode fiber.

•  Y=7 for 70/30 split ratio and 5 for 50/50 split ratio. 
Additional fiber density and adapter configurations of the 
VI TAP Patch Cassette, as well as VI MT-to-LC Cassettes 
without TAPs and MT-MT and LC-LC adapter plates, are 
available by special order.

TAP Patch Shelves

The SANInsight TAP Patch Panel System includes two 1U 
shelves, each mounting up to 4 TAP Patch Cassettes:

•   TPS-01ES is a fully-enclosed patch shelf 

with an inner tray that slides to both 
front and rear to simplify installation.

•  TPS-01OB is a fixed shelf with an open back.

Both shelves are for EIA standard 19" racks (adapter ears 
for 23" racks are available separately) and are 14" deep, 
with multiple cable tie-downs and embosses for included 
rings for secure and serviceable and cable management. 

TPS-01ES  also  has  multiple  cable  entry  knockouts  on 
the sides and rear, and uses screwed-on plates to secure 
the entry grommets to prevent accidental dislodging and 
potential abrasion damage to the cables.

TAP Patch Panel Installation Locations
TAPs are typically installed on the storage links (between 
the core switches and storage devices), as these are far 
fewer  in  number  than  the  server  links  and  still  provide 
full  access  to  all  Fiber  Channel  traffic. There  are  three 
potential locations for installing TAP Patch Panels along 
the storage links:

1.  In place of patch-only panels at the core switches;
2.  In place of patch-only panels at the storage edge;
3.  As an additive layer between the storage edge patch 

panel and storage devices (or between the storage 
edge trunk cabling and devices, if directly cabled).

Note that the patch panels in the first two options may be 
proximate to the switches and storage devices, or may 
be centrally located with trunk cabling run directly to the 
device ports.

While  the  first  two  deployment  options  are  typically 
feasible only in new installation or large-scale equipment 
refresh  scenarios,  they  are  strongly  preferred  as  they 
avoid  introducing  an  extra  cable  hop  into the  live  data 
path. Locating the TAP Patch Panels at the core switch 
links — Option  #1 — is  preferred,  as  it  enables  installing 
TAPs  onto  the  intra-switch  links  (ISLs),  as  well  as  onto 
the  storage  links.  While  the  Virtual  Instruments  SAN 
Performance Probe has a limited ability to monitor ISLs, 
the  Virtual  Instruments  Protocol  Analyzer  (and  those 
of  other  vendors)  can  effectively  trace  traffic  across 
aggregated  ISLs.  TAPs  on  ISLs  can  be  therefore  very 
valuable for diagnostics  — and very difficult or impossible 
to retrofit into live environments, making it important to 
deploy them during physical layer installation.

Option  #3  above  is the  least  preferred,  as  it  inserts  an 
additional cable hop with attendant insertion loss, material 
and  installation  cost,  and  rack  space  requirements  into 
the live data path. This may, however, be the only viable 
option for retrofitting TAPs into live environments, as the 
live links can be reconnected through the TAP Patch Panel 
a single link at a time, minimizing disruption.

Component Selection Considerations
TAP Patch Cassette selection is driven by the existing or 
planned trunk cabling and rack access requirements in 
the target installation locations, as follows:

•   If trunk cabling is MT terminated, select 

the TCV-012MRDFDF-XY Cassette.

•   If trunk cabling is LC terminated, the TCV-

012DRDFDF-XY Cassette provides the highest 
available density by connecting the trunk cabling 
to the rear of the Cassette. If the rear of the 
Cassette cannot be accessed — when retrofitting 
into existing patch links, for example   —  then 
the TCV-008DFDFDF-XY, which has all front- 
mounted adapters, is the correct Cassette.

The TCV-012 series Cassettes can be mounted in either 
the PTS-01ES or PTS-01OB shelves. Choose the former 
if  you  have  significant  cable  lengths  that  you  want  to 
manage in the shelf, or the latter if cable management is 
in the rack itself (or MT cabling is pre-terminated to the 
exact required lengths) and you need only to mount the 
Cassettes and secure the trunk cables. The PTS-01OB is 
the best shelf choice for the TCV-08 series Cassettes.
