Overview

Overview

VirtualWisdom® is the industry leading Infrastructure Performance Management Platform for your physical, virtual and cloud 
computing environments. VirtualWisdom provides granular visibility into continuous, real-time performance, health and 
utilization metrics throughout the open systems stack, driving improved performance and availability while lowering the total 
cost of the infrastructure that supports mission-critical applications.

The move to virtualized and cloud environments can help reduce CAPEX growth in servers, but this new 
paradigm can’t contribute to controlling storage CAPEX or OPEX growth in maintenance costs and staff. In 
addition, there’s often a revenue impact of downtime or unacceptable performance, which can also impact 
brand equity and customer satisfaction. If one is not vigilant, the net effect of cloud-driven consolidation, 
migration, and new technology roll-outs is increased risk and cycle time, often negating the very reason to 
move to a cloud infrastructure in the first place.

CYCLE TIME

For senior IT managers, VirtualWisdom® accelerates enterprise 
transformation by helping you guarantee the benefits of reduced capital 
expenditures, lower operational costs, and improved business agility 
promised by server virtualization and the migration to a private cloud 
infrastructure. By providing an end-to-end view of transactions, 
VirtualWisdom cuts through the haze of virtualization. At the same time, it 
reduces risk by guaranteeing superior I/O performance, which is the most 
critical component to application performance. The key to maximizing I/O 
performance is deploying instrumentation technology that directly 
measures what is going on at a deep level in the transaction workflow, 
from the virtual machine all the way to the storage array’s LUNs.

IT organizations that manage high levels of complexity in their IT infrastructures require a sophisticated set of 
capabilities to diagnose and prevent application slowdowns caused by the infrastructure, especially during 
consolidation or migration. Complexity is driven by the heterogeneity of storage subsystems, host bus adapters 
(HBAs), operating systems, fabric switches, virtualization platforms, multi-site replication, storage virtualization, 
and the continued 50% annual growth of data and bandwidth utilization. The larger the server and SAN (Storage 
Area Network) infrastructure, the greater the risk of problems. Data center consolidation, accelerated use of 
server and storage virtualization, flat budgets, and the migration to a cloud computing environment further 
complicate the infrastructure manager’s ability to track and optimize performance and availability.

For infrastructure, SAN storage operations, and server managers, 
VirtualWisdom provides very granular and continuous, real-time SAN
I/O measurement capabilities from the VM to the LUN. It enables you to 
reduce application response times, proactively avoid outages, and 
dramatically improve resource utilization. VirtualWisdom helps identify 
application performance bottlenecks in the SAN, resulting in 
significantly higher performance and utilization.

VirtualWisdom® Server and Dashboard
The VirtualWisdom Server is a robust, database-driven application that controls and collects metrics from all three probes. 
The platform persists all metrics collected over time and organizes these metrics in both physical and logical groupings. 
This enables advanced correlation and analysis across all layers of the open systems stack. This capability also delivers on 
the requirements for real-time alerting, historic trending and reporting and advanced ‘what-if’

modeling. The VirtualWisdom server also provides a fully customizable Dashboard UI, which displays a time-correlated, cross-domain view of 
the performance, utilization and health of the system as a whole, based on the deep, granular metrics available from the probes. The 
dashboard is entirely configurable, so the display and reports can be presented in a user-defined context that fits with the enterprise’s 
operational process. It also provides for integration with third-party products and management frameworks.

VirtualWisdom® Virtual Server Probe
The Virtual Server Probe is a software-based probe that is integrated with VMware vCenter and collects more than 100 metrics on the 
associated VMware estate. Some of the metrics captured by this probe include CPU utilization and status, memory utilization, disk I/O requests 
and capacity, as well as network requests and utilization by Virtual Machine, ESX Host and Cluster. The metrics are then persisted and correlated 
with the metrics from the other VirtualWisdom probes, enabling end-to-end correlation from virtual machine to the logical unit of storage.

VirtualWisdom® SAN Availability Probe
The SAN Availability Probe is a software probe that collects key data from SAN switches via SNMP. The software probes collect 
comprehensive metrics for each port by attached device type. These metrics are aggregated and reported to the VirtualWisdom 
Server on a time based interval. Each SAN Availability Probe monitors all the ports of a specific Fibre Channel switch and collects 
the metrics for each port, (such as the number of frames and bytes), as well as the key faults for each port, (such as loss of 
synchronization, link resets, link failures, packet discards, and CRC errors).

SAN Performance Probes
VI's family of hardware-based SAN Performance Probes are the most advanced, high capacity line-rate data 
inspection and analysis devices available. They inspect, process and analyze every FC frame header and SCSI 
Command on the SAN Fibre Channel links in real-time, at 2, 4 and 8 Gbits per second. They capture the true, 
unaltered, I/O profile of the actual application traffic, detecting application performance slowdowns and transmission 
errors by measuring every SCSI I/O transaction from start to finish. The SAN Performance Probe family consists of an 
8-port entry level device, a high-density 16-port model, and the latest ultra high-density 48-port enterprise edition, all 
in a 2U footprint. This product family delivers the full range of cost and density options customers require.

SANInsight® TAP Patch Panel System
Traffic Access Points (TAPs) provide a passive, fail-safe access point to Fibre Channel network traffic on the TAPped link. 

This makes the ‘light’ available for real-time performance monitoring, deep problem diagnosis and protocol layer failure analysis. TAPs are 
non-powered, non-mechanical devices that reflect a small portion of the signal through the TAP to another port, which provides a copy of the 
light to upstream, out of band probes. The passive TAP does not introduce any latency or overhead, has no impact on application or SAN 
performance and is integrated with several industry leading Fibre Channel Patch Panel Systems for simple deployment.

Solutions: 
Problems that Virtual Instruments Solves

How can I mitigate the risk of moving 
mission-critical applications to a private cloud infrastructure?
Cloud computing offers many benefits, but IT staff lose the ability to “see” through 
the cloud, jeopardizing their ability to troubleshoot problems and assure 
performance meets application SLAs. It’s no secret that many companies are 
reluctant to virtualize their most mission-critical applications, leaving 70%+ of 
today’s enterprise applications still running on purely physical infrastructures. 
What happens when an application slows? VirtualWisdom allows the private 
cloud infrastructure to be instrumented, monitored, and constantly, yet 
unobtrusively, measured to see how it is affecting applications. Traditional 
management tools, even those from VMware, can’t see the effect of I/O on 
performance. VirtualWisdom provides server and storage administrators a 
common view from the virtual machine to the LUN, dramatically reducing the risk 
of moving mission-critical applications to a private cloud infrastructure.

How can I use VirtualWisdom® to improve business agility and reduce cycle time?
VirtualWisdom delivers the required visibility to ensure a successful infrastructure 
and application deployment. IT managers can monitor production deployment 
rollouts in real time to ensure all is performing as expected, with no
mis-configurations or version incompatibilities. VirtualWisdom finds performance 
inhibitors before they bubble up to the application layer, accelerating new 
deployments, consolidations and technology migrations. VirtualWisdom helps 
validate new technologies by providing very granular and continuous real-time 
measurements to determine the positive or negative performance impact of IT 
infrastructure changes.

How do I avoid future application performance degradations?
Performance problems are avoided by proactively monitoring the infrastructure 
with the complete set of VirtualWisdom probes. Proactively monitoring by setting 
alarms and running periodic reports prevents performance issues and eliminates 
more serious downtime issues. As one example, VirtualWisdom is the only 
product that can measure real-time aggregated queue depth (regardless of 
storage vendor or device) to ensure storage ports are optimized for maximum 
application performance.

How can I reduce risk and unplanned application downtime?
Proactively monitoring the IT infrastructure with VirtualWisdom reduces downtime 
by finding hidden problems. Every network has hidden issues, from physical layer 
errors to configuration and load-balancing issues. Almost all application outages 
are the result of a combination of these issues. By setting alerts key to these 
issues, administrators can proactively eliminate them while they are still benign, 
making SAN administration a proactive activity rather than a series of
fire-fighting drills. Being able to effectively address potential issues before 
application users report problems creates a more methodical process of ensuring 
application availability and reducing risk.

view of application instance metrics, here, showing read 
responses for two applications are unacceptable and

indicators of potential performance problems

How can I resolve infrastructure problems 5X faster? 
Time to problem resolution is decreased by monitoring transactions from the 
VM to the LUN with the complete set of VirtualWisdom probes. The ability to 
prove within minutes whether the SAN is to blame for slow application 
performance focuses the right team on the task and allows other teams to 
remain focused on other business imperatives. Running historical reports to 
look back in time enables faster problem identification and resolution. 
VirtualWisdom is the only product that can monitor and send an alert about 
storage access times, congestion, link errors, and SCSI errors, and generate 
trend reports that show the behavior of a heterogeneous SAN, by virtual 
machine and by application. This information can reduce troubleshooting time 
by up to 80% and allows the IT manager to immediately prove whether the 
problem is in the SAN, the application, or the server. This simple first step 
speeds troubleshooting by days, weeks, or even months.

How can I reduce my storage costs by >40% through better tiering?
With VirtualWisdom, IT organizations can use lower-cost Tier II storage to 
provide Tier I performance using latency data and other information to properly 
plan and optimize the environment. This is combined with real-time alerting 
capabilities to prevent user impact as demands change, enabling IT to realize 
huge CAPEX savings. The organization can use Tier II or Tier III storage for all 
applications except those that actually demand other Tier I attributes. When the 
decision is based on performance, VirtualWisdom offers the real-time analysis 
that proves the effect of the storage arrays on application response time. The 
ability to use less expensive storage can result in 40-50% cost per terabyte 
savings and reduce floor space, power, and cooling requirements by up to 80%.

How can I proactively determine how storage virtualization impacts performance?
Storage virtualization adds a new layer of abstraction into the SAN 
infrastructure. Most storage and SAN managers have no idea how the storage 
virtualization products impact application performance. By using 
VirtualWisdom to establish a baseline, the performance impact will be 
immediately known and quantified.

How can I lower storage networking costs by >25% via SAN consolidation?
We have consistently found that SANs at larger companies are significantly 
over-provisioned, with average network utilization rates of less than 10%. 
VirtualWisdom can help you reclaim underutilized SAN ports and avoid 
acquiring additional expensive core switch ports, storage ports, related cables, 
and SFPs. Buy only what you need. Running reports that show latency and 
throughput per port enable the comparison and recommendation of 
optimizations that balance utilization and increase consolidation.

How can I accelerate the deployment of 
mission-critical applications on virtual servers? 
Today, >50% of mission-critical applications are still running on physical 
servers. Although there are other potential reasons for the lack of
mission-critical application deployments (e.g. security), a huge impediment is 
the risk to application performance and availability. VirtualWisdom (with the 
Virtual Server Probe) enables VMware and SAN administrators to work together 
to ensure that SAN-related performance issues are mitigated or completely 
avoided. This enables IT to provision substantially more mission-critical 
applications, reduce cycle times, and improve virtualization ROI.

This dashboard widget clearly shows a latency problem 
in the SAN by identifying an Exchange Completion Time 
of over 41 milliseconds, at the server port.

This widget shows that the busiest ports on the SAN 
vary between 13% and 2% utilization.

Here, you can see time-correlated metrics, including 
average CPU utilization, disk I/O latency, and the worst ITL 
Exchange Completion Times. Together, these widgets offer 
real-time evidence of the effect of conﬁguration changes.

VirtualWisdom® Complements Your Current Management Solutions

Today’s most common management solutions—such as Enterprise Management Frameworks, Storage Resource Managers, 
Virtual Server Monitors, Application Performance Monitors, and SAN Fabric Managers—all lack physical, continuous real-time 
monitoring of the I/O path from the VM to the LUN at a very granular level. These legacy management products typically poll 
devices and average the metrics over 5 - 20 minute periods, which is insufficient to identify and resolve problems, especially 
intermittent problems and complex problems that have more than a single cause. The VirtualWisdom platform is the only 
product that can non-intrusively optimize the performance and availability of applications by measuring and correlating actual 
I/O traffic data from the VM, Physical Server, Switch Fabric and Storage LUN.
