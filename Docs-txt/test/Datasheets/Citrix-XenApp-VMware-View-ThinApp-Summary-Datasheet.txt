Enhancing a Citrix XenApp Implementation 
with VMware View and ThinApp

AT A GLANCE

Would you like to increase the value of your Citrix XenApp 
implementation	and	speed	your	journey	to	the	cloud?	Are	
you	considering	enhancing	your	productivity	tools	with	
virtual	desktops	and	virtual	applications?	VMware	View™		
and	VMware	ThinApp™	can	help	you.	

Implementing	VMware	View	and	VMware	ThinApp	are	the	
first	steps	toward	embracing	the	next-generation	
technologies	to	access	your	data,	your	desktops,	and	your	
applications	from	the	cloud.	View	provides	the	virtual	
desktop infrastructure while ThinApp provides the 
application	virtualization	technology—together	they	will	
help	you	to	modernize	your	work	environment.

If	you	are	ready	for	a	desktop	virtualization	solution,	and	
you	want	to	keep	your	XenApp	implementation,	VMware	
View	readily	incorporates	XenApp	into	its	infrastructure.	In	
addition,	if	you	are	already	familiar	with	VMware	vSphere	
for	server	virtualization,	managing	vSphere	as	the	
infrastructure	behind	VMware	View	will	be	easy	for	you.

VMware View Enhances XenApp
VMware View’s virtual desktop infrastructure enhances  
Citrix XenApp in various ways:

•	Isolates	users

•	Reduces	capital	expenses	and	operational	costs

•	Leverages	the	power	and	ease	of	management	of	 

vSphere/ESX/ESXi

Isolates users
By	adding	VMware	View	to	your	environment,	you	provide 	 
users	with	their	own	desktops,	including	their	own	operating 	
system	and	applications.	Users	do	not	conflict	with	each	other. 	
XenApp	provides	users	with	a	shared	operating	system	and 	
shared	applications,	and	this	can	create	conflict	of	resources 	
between	users.	

Reduces capital expenses and operational costs
Virtual	desktop	environments	take	less	effort	to	manage	and	use 	
less	expensive	hardware	than	standard	computing.	Companies 	
have	realized	tremendous	savings	by	converting	their	more 	
expensive	PC	hardware	to	smaller,	less	expensive	thin	clients. 	
Administrators	have	also	benefited	by	saving	time	and	gaining 	
control	through	a	centralized	management	platform.	Users	still 	
enjoy	the	flexibility	and	mobility	of	anywhere	access	to	their 	
desktop.		

Leverages the power and ease of management of  
vSphere/ESX/ESXi
If	you	already	have	VMware	ESX/vSphere,	you	are	familiar	with 	
the	ease	of	management	and	industry-leading	capabilities	that 	
vSphere	provides.	VMware	View	and	vSphere	are	tightly 	
integrated	and	together	provide	unique	capabilities	such	as	fully 	
virtualized	3D	graphics	and	storage	cost	savings	from	View 	
Storage	Accelerator	that	are	not	available	with	other	virtual 	
desktop	solutions.	Plus	the	underlying	infrastructure	is	familiar. 	 
If	you	have	used	VMware	vSphere	to	virtualize	your	XenApp 	
Servers,	you	can	use	your	vSphere	expertise	to	run	View	virtual 	
desktops	on	the	same	familiar	infrastructure.	

If	you	are	adding	a	virtual	desktop	solution	to	your	XenApp 	
environment,	VMware	View	has	the	following	advantages	over 	
other	solutions	on	the	market:

•	View	directly	leverages	the	power	of	vSphere

•	View	is	easier	to	deploy	and	manage

•	View	has	lower	total	cost	of	ownership

VMware	View	is	the	leading	virtual	desktop	solution	providing 	
greater	flexibility,	exceptional	user	experience	and	lower	total 	
cost	of	ownership.

Enhancing a Citrix XenApp Implementation 
with VMware View and ThinApp

Citrix	XenApp	can	publish	ThinApp	applications,	and	VMware	
View	desktops	can	display	Citrix	XenApp	applications,	as	in	the	
following	figure.

ThinApp	simplifies	a	XenApp	environment.	Placing	one	copy	of	a	
ThinApp	virtualized	application	on	a	file	share	is	much	simpler	
than	installing	multiple	copies	of	XenApp	applications	on	multiple	
servers	in	server	farms.	If	you	stream	packages	from	the	ThinApp	
file	share	to	the	XenApp	Server	via	a	LAN,	and	then	present	
applications	from	the	XenApp	Server	over	the	WAN	or	Internet	to	
end	users,	you	can	take	advantage	of	the	combined	ThinApp-
XenApp	solution.

Whether	you	are	considering	the	cost	and	simplicity	advantages 	
of	a	virtual	desktop	infrastructure	or	the	ease	of	management 	
and	enablement	gained	from	application	virtualization,	VMware 	
has	a	solution	to	match	your	needs.	VMware	View	Premier 	
comes	with	both	ThinApp	and	vSphere,	the	leading	server 	
virtualization	platform	for	VDI,	providing	all	the	virtualization 	 
you	need	in	one	convenient	package,	at	one	great	price. 	 
All	components	integrate	directly	with	XenApp	and	add 	
tremendous	value	to	any	XenApp	environment	while	taking	you 	
closer	to	your	journey	to	the	cloud. 	

VMware ThinApp Enhances XenApp
VMware	View	Premier	package	comes	with	ThinApp,	the	leading 	
application	virtualization	platform.	This	powerful	combination	is 	
a	critical	enabler	for	your	journey	to	the	cloud.	Presenting 	
ThinApp	virtual	applications	through	Citrix	XenApp	provides	the 	
following	benefits:

Requires only a single application instance
With	ThinApp	in	a	XenApp	implementation,	you	need	only	one 	
copy	of	the	virtualized	application	stored	on	a	ThinApp	file 	
share.	With	other	applications	presented	with	XenApp,	you	must 	
install	the	same	application	on	each	of	the	XenApp	Servers	in 	
your	server	farm,	and	each	of	these	native	installations	must	be 	
individually	maintained.

Eliminates application conflict
To	avoid	application	conflicts,	Citrix	isolates	applications	from 	
each	other	via	XenApp	silos,	which	requires	additional	hardware. 	
ThinApp	isolates	applications	with	software,	not	hardware. 	
ThinApp	virtual	applications	are	already	isolated	from	each	other 	
and	therefore	can	be	placed	on	the	same	XenApp	Server.

Enables quick recovery
If	a	XenApp	Server	fails,	you	have	to	reinstall	the	entire	XenApp 	
server.	However,	if	you	have	stored	your	virtual	applications 	
separately	on	a	ThinApp	file	share,	you	have	only	the	baseline 	
XenApp	server	to	reinstall,	and	you	do	not	have	to	reinstall	the 	
applications.

Simplifies and speeds updates
With	a	standard	Citrix	XenApp	setup,	you	must	update	each 	
natively	installed	application	on	each	XenApp	Server,	and	you 	
need	to	take	each	server	offline	to	update	the	applications.	If	you 	
use	ThinApp	to	virtualize	applications,	you	update	only	the 	
single	application	on	the	file	share,	and	ThinApp	applications	can 	
be	updated	automatically	while	in	use.

Virtualizes IE6 and enables migration to Windows
ThinApp	allows	you	to	virtualize	Microsoft	Internet	Explorer	6 	
(IE6),	and	you	can	package	IE6	along	with	a	legacy	application 	
that	depends	upon	IE6	or	an	older	version	of	Java.	Users	can	run 	
virtual	IE6	alongside	a	later	version	of	native	IE	on	the	same 	
desktop.	The	migration	to	Windows	7	or	to	later	Windows 	
versions	becomes	easier	if	you	have	the	option	of	carrying 	
forward	any	IE6-dependent	legacy	applications.

Integrating VMware View and VMware ThinApp  
with Citrix XenApp Is Easy
VMware	View	virtual	desktops	give	your	users	isolated	use	of 	 
the	operating	system	and	applications,	just	as	with	a	physical 	
desktop,	but	with	less	cost.	Placing	shortcuts	on	View	desktops 	
to	XenApp-presented	ThinApp	virtual	applications	gives	users 	
the	best	of	all	three	solutions.
