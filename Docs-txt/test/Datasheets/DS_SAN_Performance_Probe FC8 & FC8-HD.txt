Introduction

The VirtualWisdom SAN Performance Probe is the industry’s only real time, 
full line rate monitoring solution for Fibre Channel storage area networks 
(SANs). Working  completely  out-of-band, the  SAN  Performance  Probe 
analyzes every frame on monitored SAN links and reports hundreds of 
metrics every second that provide comprehensive, accurate, and vendor 
agnostic monitoring from the protocol level.

from  other  VirtualWisdom  Probes,  SAN 
Together  with  metrics 
Performance  Probe  metrics  are  stored  and  presented  by  the 
VirtualWisdom Portal Server, providing holistic, timely insight into the 
health,  utilization,  and  performance  of  large-scale,  heterogeneous 
open systems-based infrastructure.

VirtualWisdom  provides  best-in-class  capabilities 
for  monitoring, 
visualizing,  and  analyzing  these  metrics,  delivering  a  comprehensive 
solution across all layers of infrastructure performance management:

•   Proactive Monitoring. VirtualWisdom provides early identification of 
emergent  performance,  health,  or  utilization  issues,  enabling  rapid 
execution of corrective actions, mitigating the risk of performance 
impacting events.

•   Deep  Diagnostics.  Detailed,  time-coherent  data  helps  to  identify 
the  root  causes  of  even  sporadic  and  complex  performance  and 
availability issues so they can be decisively eliminated.

•   Planning and analysis. Comprehensive insight into the relationships between workload, performance, and utilization supports 
the optimal alignment of application demands with infrastructure capabilities to deliver the required performance at the 
lowest cost and highest availability.

Deployment

The SAN Performance Probe is typically deployed on the links between storage ports and next-tier switches, or, if fabric 
based storage virtualizers are deployed, on both sides of the virtualizers. Connectivity to the live link is provided by a 
traffic access point (TAP), which uses passive optical couplers to access the signal traveling over both channels that 
comprise a link. The TAP diverts a small amount of the optical power on each channel to a full line rate monitoring output 
for out-of-band access by the SAN Performance Probe. TAPs certified for compatibility with the SAN Performance Probe 
are available from both Virtual Instruments and a growing number of leading physical infrastructure providers.

Monitoring and Metrics

Whether connected directly to the TAP or via a Rover, the SAN Performance Probe monitors and inspects all received 
traffic at the full line rate and reports hundreds of metrics every second, including:

•   Health. Metrics including CRCs and other frame errors, loss of signal/synch, logins/logouts, SCSI check conditions, 

discards, and aborts are all monitored to identify transmission, exchange, or fabric-level errors and trends.

•   Utilization. The amount and type of traffic on each channel is monitored, providing direct observation of channel  — and 
port-level utilizations and the fabric operating state. Metrics can be flexibly aggregated by VirtualWisdom to monitor 
the utilization of backplanes, control processors, and other critical device resources.

•   Performance. The SAN Performance Probe monitors the performance of every SCSI exchange between each unique 
combination of initiator port, target port, and LUN (ITL), calculating metrics by exchange type including completion 
time, time to first response, and size. As with other VirtualWisdom metrics, these performance measurements can be 
flexibly aggregated in user-defined contexts to enable monitoring of total I/O workload, type of I/O, and performance 
by business application, application tier, storage tier, or other logical grouping.

High–Impact Performance Insight

While all three categories of metrics provide valuable insight, the performance metrics are both the most differentiated 
and the most impactful. They are differentiated because no other solution has the ability to measure I/O performance 
across the SAN at comparable levels of frequency and detail. They are impactful because of the increased efficiency and 
effectiveness they drive across the Infrastructure Performance Management domains:

•   Monitoring.  Performance  metrics  provide  the  most  accurate  and  timely  indicator  into  the  state  of  the  entire 
infrastructure. Utilization or health problems emergent at any level can often be identified in their earliest stages by 
their impact on performance.

•   Diagnostics. The “3 dimensional” view of the concurrent state of utilization, health, and performance is vitally important 
to root cause diagnostics, especially of multi-faceted problems that may originate in areas of the SAN far removed 
from where their impacts are first observed.

•   Planning and Analysis. The comprehensive and accurate view combining application I/O workload with infrastructure 
performance and utilization is the fundamental key to better aligning application requirements with the performance 
capabilities, utilization levels, and costs of different tiers and configurations of infrastructure.

Connectivity

•   SAN  Link  Interface.  Connectivity  to  the TAP  monitor  outputs  is  provided  via  field-replaceable  small  form  factor 

pluggable plus (SFP+) optical transceivers.

•   SAN  Link  Capacity. The  SAN  Performance  ProbeFC8  monitors  up  to  8  concurrent  SAN  Links;  the  ProbeFC8-HD 
monitors up to 16 concurrent SAN Links; both support 2/4/8 Gbps Fibre Channel speeds. Either SAN Performance 
Probe can be optionally connected to the TAPs through SANInsight Rover, a software-controlled physical layer switch 
that timeshares Performance Probe capacity across tens to hundreds of SAN Links.

•   VirtualWisdom Platform Connectivity. The SAN Performance Probe connects to the VirtualWisdom server platform 
via Gigabit Ethernet (via rear panel RJ45 Ethernet jack) to transfer calculated SAN metrics for persistent storage, 
analysis, and display.

Deployment and Serviceability

•   True appliance without local console or remote shell access. Updates for all software and firmware on the device are 

administered remotely via VirtualWisdom.

•  Redundant hot-swappable power supply modules for high availability.
•  Field-replaceable and — reversible cooling fan modules support both front-to-rear and rear-to-front airflow.
•  Front panel LCD display with keypad for local configuration and status monitoring.
