 Virtual Instruments Professional Services Improves 
Storage Infrastructure at Leading American Retailer 
 
Leading American Retailer offers high quality, on-trend clothing, accessories and 
personal care products at affordable prices in 1,000+ stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
The online store ships to more than 60 countries worldwide and is in constant growth 
mode with new products, new services, and new countries upon to transact business.  

This leading Retailer was experiencing periodic application performance issues that were affect-
ing both the retail stores as well as the online operations. It was not clear if the performance 
was originating from the application servers, SAN fabric, storage or a combination thereof but it 
was a chronic problem that was burning up IT staff time and cross IT group goodwill.  

The inability to pinpoint the exact causes of application slow down led to ‘finger-pointing’ at the 
SAN infrastructure and particularly the storage virtualization solution brought in to simplify 
management and improve performance.  

Virtual Instruments combined efforts with the storage vendor to analyze and identify areas of 
inefficiency within the SAN at their main data center. The analysis, using Virtual Instrument’s 
VirtualWisdom SAN Availability & Optimization solution, monitored the storage virtualization as 
well as SNMP data from the 2 Fibre Channel switches associated with those links for 
performance and error conditions. VirtualWisdom’s real-time and historical data path 
monitoring, trending, and reporting capabilities offer unique visibility into Fibre Channel SAN 
traffic and data flows to proactively ensure a continually balanced, optimized, and trouble-free 
SAN infrastructure, while proactively alerting SAN administrators to issues before application or 
user impact

Latency and Responsiveness 
Virtual Instruments’ VirtualWisdom proved that the SAN was working correctly and that storage 
virtualization was clearly improving the performance of the environment. On average, the read 
response times through the virtualized storage were less than half what they would be if the re-
quests were going directly to the storage arrays. Based on this analysis no corrective action was 
needed with regard to the storage virtualization. It was also proven that the SAN performance 
benefitted and that opportunity for further benefits existed.  

An additional benefit of Virtual Instruments’ analysis was that VirtualWisdom showed the pos-
sibility to further leverage the existing virtualization by using lower cost storage alternatives 
going forward.  

Application Performance Issues 
Several times during the course of the service, specific applications were reported to have 
experienced problems.  The analysis of the monitoring data proved that none of the 
performance problems could be attributed to the SAN.  Once the SAN was ruled out as a cause 
of performance issues, the focus of the investigation could be narrowed significantly. Issues with 
other applications, servers, associated databases and the operating system were also noted 
during the investigation.  The Virtual Instruments Professional Services team recommended 
specific areas of focus to be examined including:  

• 

Continuous monitoring and trending of application bandwidth demands ensuring that 
optimal Fabric utilization is maintained.  

•  Balancing the I/O load across all storage ports to help maximize the storage utilization.  
• 

Long-term trending will help determine how applications can be more evenly 
distributed across the initiators and ensure a more fully utilized infrastructure.  

•  Based on the bandwidth and performance information collected during the service; 
Virtual Instruments determined that the existing SAN infrastructure could support 
conservatively 20% more servers.  

Capacity Planning 
Using VirtualWisdom, the analysis showed that nearly 20% of SAN traffic was coming from 2 
servers, that 66% of SAN traffic was coming from 10 HBA’s, and that less than 20% of the HBA’s 
were responsible for 80% of the traffic.  

This insight enabled the storage administrators to plan, design and manage their environment 
much more effectively. By tuning the SAN for the actual demand, significant savings and efficien-
cies could be achieved.

Configuration 
VirtualWisdom quickly discovered that several servers did not have redundant HBA’s or the load 
balancing software was not working adequately. Virtual Instruments recommended that the 
non-redundant HBA’s needed to be brought online and that on-going monitoring be continued 
to ensure that the SAN continues to have all of its fail-safe measures in place.  

Events and Errors 
The Virtual Instruments professional services team was able to determine that servers were 
being rebooted and transactions were cancelled even while the SAN is performing well. These 
activities occurred with much greater frequency that other SANs of this size, resulting in a likely 
inefficient use of application and server team’s time and resources.  

Virtual Instruments’ recommendation was that application and server logs should be examined 
to determine the root cause of these problems. Continued monitoring of the SAN environment 
can help the application, server and SAN teams to work together to resolve and prevent these 
types of issues.  

Summary  
Virtual Instruments Professional Services SAN Availability & Optimization Services based on 
VirtualWisdom was able to help Leading American Retailer to narrow down the source of perfor-
mance issues to the servers and eliminate the ‘finger-pointing’ at the SAN, its administrators and 
storage vendor.  

Other benefits from the service were validation that the storage virtualization was reducing 
latency and improving application performance; quick identification of application servers at risk 
for outage due to issues with FC HBAs; determine that existing SAN infrastructure had room for 
improvement and could support more servers.
