Challenge 
  Booming demand for cloud services 

  Clients requiring rapid access to cloud offerings 

Solution  
  Vblock™ Infrastructure Platforms

  Cloud offerings rolled out to new clients in less than a month 

  Resources freed to develop differentiated services 

  Integrated solutions streamline security, compliance, and change management  

  New business opportunities opened up by VCE partnership 

Challenge 
ACS leverages best practices in business process outsourcing and enterprise IT to help an increasing number of 
clients meet their business challenges with cloud services. The company’s clients want rapid access to these 
services, so reducing engineering time to integrate cloud and virtualization technologies is important. ACS 
recognized that Vblock Infrastructure Platforms would not only shorten time to delivery but also enable 
differentiated services and new business models.  

Steve Houser, ACS chief technology officer of cloud services and engineering, states, “ACS has been working 
with Cisco, EMC, and VMware for a long time. Being able to plug into VCE really upped the relationship and 
provided a new way for us to partner. We’re able to benefit from preconfigured Vblock Infrastructure Platforms to 
meet client demands very quickly. And our partnership with VCE represents an extension of our team, which lets 
us more rapidly address the booming and global cloud market.” 

Solution 
To enable clients to move to the cloud faster, ACS’s cloud offering is 100 percent deployed on Vblock 
Infrastructure Platforms. The converged, pre-integrated, and tested Vblock platform includes Cisco Unified 
Computing System (UCS) blade servers, Cisco networking components, EMC storage systems, and VMware 
vSphere virtualization technology. 

ACS uses Vblock Infrastructure Platforms to drive the operation of three ACS cloud nodes that are in production. 
Two are in the United States and one is in the Asia-Pacific region. In the coming year, the company plans to add 
another three to four cloud nodes based on Vblock Infrastructure Platforms.

Results 

Getting Agile with Standard, Single-Source Infrastructure 
According to ACS, business agility and faster time to market are among the main reasons its customers are 
interested in cloud services. Partnering with VCE and standardizing on Vblock platforms help the company 
respond to these needs more rapidly. 

Houser tells the story of a customer in Asia that wanted to use cloud services: “We engaged VCE, quickly 
determined what size Vblock platform was appropriate, and had the solution deployed in less than a week. We 
were able to deliver that node with very little manpower on our side. 

“Then we opened up marketing to our other customers in the region. We now have three customers leveraging 
that one Vblock platform, and we are easily expanding that infrastructure to meet customer demand. 

“The Vblock platform is providing both our business and clients with tremendous agility. Not only can a business 
application owner quickly spin up multiple virtual machines on a particular application, but they can choose to 
create test environments that are only needed for a week.” 

Pre-integrated Platforms Make Time for Differentiation 
Because Vblock Infrastructure Platforms are factory-built products from a single vendor, ACS does not have to 
spend time assembling the underlying cloud infrastructure.  

“Given that Vblock products are prepackaged, pre-engineered, and pre-integrated, we have more time to focus on 
the value-added nature of cloud,” Houser observes. “We’re creating better value, and differentiated value, for 
customers of our cloud services. 

“We have elected to differentiate in several areas. One is the direct integration of IT service management, which 
lets our customers integrate their traditionally managed workloads with cloud workloads. Another differentiator for 
ACS’s cloud offering involves role-based access control and other aspects of security. We get a head start by 
building on top of the security capabilities that are foundational aspects of Vblock Infrastructure Platforms.” 

Houser explains, “We’re able to drop a Vblock platform in, layer in our cloud automation components, and bring a 
customer up in less than a month. It’s just simpler to meet client demands very quickly.”  

Vblock Platform Meets Security, Compliance, and Control Requirements 
Hemanth Jayaraman, enterprise architect at ACS, notes that enterprise customers have to be diligent about 
security, compliance, and control when they use cloud services.  

“VCE and the Vblock platform make it much more straightforward to address these challenges,” states 
Jayaraman. “VCE takes responsibility for integrating the products from each of their parent companies. We benefit 
from an integrated roadmap that relieves our IT shop from doing the product testing, integration, and patching. 
VCE does the work that helps us with the compliance and change management our clients require.” 

VCE Partnership Delivers Value; Enables New Business Models 
ACS is able to offer customers significant benefits as a result of its partnership with VCE.  

“Clearly, rapid time to service and business agility are key elements,” states Houser. “And we have absolutely 
seen cost savings for our customer base in moving from traditional IT outsourcing to a cloud business model. 
Teaming up with VCE helps us accelerate our customers’ journey to virtualization and the cloud.”  

Houser adds, “Our cloud services start at a horizontal layer. On top of that layer, we are working with VCE to 
develop different vertical industry offerings for healthcare and other markets. We can address the full cycle from 
infrastructure to software as a service to business process utility. 

“The Vblock Infrastructure Platforms and our VCE relationship help us deliver new business models that address 
real business issues for our customers—and do it in a timely fashion.”
