Telecom company deploys VirtualWisdom to monitor its 
SAN to ensure highest possible data availability 
­  Anticipate the peaks and valleys caused by product launches 
­  Avoid or mitigate problems before they cause application 

slowdowns or outages 

Overview  

This U.S. telecommunications company provides fixed and mobile telephony, broadband and 
subscription television services, as well as internet services, with tens of millions of customers.   

IT Environment  
Their IT department supports three major U.S. data centers, with data warehouses generating 
heavy I/O workloads.  Activities often peak during significant product launches of new mobile 
phones, when hundreds of thousands of activations occur in a short period of time.  IT is 
considered a strategic advantage and the goal is to continue to push the envelope and to be 
more leading edge.  Product launches are expected to be fully supported with 99.999% 
availability and no negative impact to response time.   
Storage is split between tier 1 and tier 2 arrays, with customer-facing services on tier 1, primarily 
HDS and EMC enterprise class arrays.   Tier 2 storage is based primarily on HP EVA systems. Total 
online storage exceeds 75 PB and is growing.   
Servers mostly run Unix and Linux, but their IT department supports many host operating 
systems connected to their SAN.  The Fibre Channel switches are nearly all director-class devices.  
The SAN infrastructure is provided by a variety of top tier vendors. 

Because this institution considers IT to be a competitive edge, there is pressure to not only 
maintain superior customer-facing application performance and overall high application 
availability, but also to deploy the newest technologies quickly.

testing methodologies such as EMC’s Ionix ControlCenter and Brocade’s DCFM, while critical to 
many management tasks, were not up to the challenge of optimizing existing applications, 
improving customer service, and making technology leaps all at the same time

.   

Challenges and Concerns 

One of the key challenges was in maintaining traditional high service levels in the face of 
accelerating data growth and huge spikes in I/O load, while keeping costs down.  In such a 
service-oriented business, response time and availability are absolutely critical.  Any negative 
user experiences become front-page news around the world.  With a growing number of ports 
and disk, lack of standardization amongst vendor-supplied tools, and an inability to do predictive 
problem avoidance, it was becoming a challenge to manage and optimize the SAN.  For a select 
number of business-critical services, increasing data availability and reducing performance issues 
were the key imperatives.  But simply buying more hardware and over-provisioning the 
infrastructure was becoming cost-prohibitive. 

Solution Evaluation  

The IT team was challenged with tight budgets and with getting better performance from 
existing resources.  To do this, senior IT management knew it must be proactive; it had to avoid 
problems and anticipate issues before users and application owners were affected.  The only 
way to do this without dramatically increasing the staff size was to find some way to proactively 
automate the monitoring and analysis of the effect of the SAN on application availability.   The 
team put a set of criteria together and specifically looked for: 
•  A complementary solution to existing vendor-oriented management and monitoring 

solutions.  A reporting mechanism that could take a deeper look than vendor-supplied tools, 
something at the hardware level to find things that might cause application problems 
Centralized monitoring, to accommodate multiple datacenters 

• 
•  A predictive analysis tool, something that could alert to issues before they become serious 

problems that would affect users 

•  A vendor-neutral solution that would enable them to avoid finger pointing and empower 

the vendors to offer better advice in a proactive manner 

VirtualWisdom was the Answer 

After an initial consulting-only engagement, VirtualWisdom software and SANInsight hardware 
monitoring were deployed in 2010, eventually supporting over 35,000 fibre channel ports, 
including over 500 ports connected to the ProbeFCX.  Specific Virtual Instruments benefits to the 
IT team included: 
• 

Improved communications with server team and storage vendors.  Customer can send 
vendors the VirtualWisdom reports and ask for their advice.  The vendor and device-
independent support of VirtualWisdom  virtually eliminates vendor finger pointing 

•  A non-intrusive monitoring solution with no impact on application hosts  
• 
• 

Problems are identified before they affect application performance or availability 
Storage tiering strategies can now be validated via a neutral third-party solution to help 
match application requirements with the appropriate tier of storage

•  Quantitative modeling helps eliminate “rules of thumb” capacity and performance planning; 

• 

provides critical input for future purchasing decisions. 
Faster troubleshooting – incident identification and resolution process was dramatically 
improved via trend analysis and access to metrics there was simply no other way to see 

•  Helps enable the IT infrastructure to comply with service level agreements  

Troubleshooting the SAN  

According to this leading telecommunications service provider, VirtualWisdom has enabled them 
to more quickly respond to potential performance and availability problems.  In many cases, 
they got an early warning of failing devices and were able to replace them before they 
completely failed and caused significant problems.   

Application Performance 

Ultimately, the storage staff is judged by how effectively they support the application 
consumers.  According to a senior administrator, “reducing the instances of response time 
problems has probably been the most obvious benefit to deploying VirtualWisdom.  Getting 
fewer trouble tickets is an obvious way to point to a solid ROI for this decision”. 

SAN QuickStart Assessment 

In late 2010, VI performed a QuickStart Assessment Service at one of the major datacenters; 
below are a couple of the key findings. 

Class 3 Discards 

A Class 3 Discard occurs when a switch drops a Fibre Channel frame while providing the 
Class 3 level of service. The switch notes that it has dropped the frame but no notification is 
provided to either the initiator or the target. Higher-level functions on the host or storage 
array are typically designed to overcome the problem of the missing frame.  These dropped 
frames have several side effects. The multiple full exchange requests attempted in order to 
complete a single problematic data request will cause increased utilization as well as a 
significant delay in completing the data request. A high volume of Class 3 Discards may also 
cause a switch to perform a Link Reset, in order to re-negotiate the number of buffer-to-
buffer credits it has available.  Leaving the root cause of a Class 3 Discard unresolved also 
leaves the SAN in a state that is more likely to see a significant diminishment of service or an 
outage caused by compounding root causes. The numbers found were significant and 
immediate remediation was recommended.

The multipath verification and redundancy analysis showed that 48% of the HBAs were 
balanced while 18% were Active/Active but not balanced. 11% of the servers were 
configured as Active/Passive. 10% of the HBAs were found not to have a peer HBA that 
could be identified.  Because there can be a significant performance impact due to servers 
not working in an Active/Active fashion, VI recommended that the environment should be 
reviewed to ensure that all servers are performing per their configuration. The HBAs that do 
not have peers should also be reviewed to ensure they don’t require redundancy or are 
peers themselves. The imbalanced HBAs should be checked to make sure they are all zoned 
to the same storage array or are behaving as expected.

Performance 

During the review period, there were two large spikes in response times.  These spikes were 
further investigated, by looking at the one minute summary on the dashboard to examine 
long Exchange Completion Times.  Both slowdowns only occurred for 3-4 minutes (see graph 
below), something that other monitoring tools could not find due to their use of averaging 
metrics. By drilling down further, it was demonstrated that an HBA with a high queue depth 
setting was impacting the performance of the other hosts.  VI’s recommendation was to set 
the queue depths to a lower figure and set an alert on those ITL paths to watch for any 
problems.

As mentioned above, queue depths can have a dramatic impact on performance. With 
Queue depth settings set too high, storage ports can be overrun or congested, you can 
experience poor application performance and even data corruption. Though there is a 
queue depth policy in place, several serious violations were found, as evidenced by “Max 
Pending Exchanges” below.

Lessons Learned 

When asked what the IT team would recommend to new VirtualWisdom customers, the person 
who uses VirtualWisdom most frequently replied “Take advantage of the collective experience 
of the VI consultants and of other VI customers.  VirtualWisdom generates a lot of metrics and 
learning quickly to pay attention to the most important ones is critical”.   

The company found that most vendors welcomed the additional reports they got from 
VirtualWisdom.  It’s interesting to see which vendors like the idea of a third party monitoring 
solution like Virtual Instruments.  Since the company has a redundant SAN infrastructure, it was 
easy to add the SANInsight Fibre Channel TAPs (signal splitters) during maintenance windows 
with no effect on users.  Having said that, it would be better to provide TAPs when the initial 
SAN is deployed, and make it a corporate standard.  The cost is small, and the upside is 
significant.
