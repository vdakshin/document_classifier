A leading provider of cloud-based communications and computing solutions, 8x8 
Inc. has approximately 350 employees and is an established provider of cloud 
services to small and medium sized businesses. 8x8 made a strategic decision to 
expand its target market to larger enterprise and government customers. This 
would require the deployment of a new, more robust infrastructure that could offer 
enterprise-class reliability as well as ease of use. 

The company found a solution in Vblock™ Systems from VCE™. As Andrew 
Schwabecher, general manager–hosting services put it, “Vblock Systems are ideal for 
a hosting infrastructure used for enterprise applications. The Vblock system ensures 
full symmetric fault tolerance with no single point of failure. That means we can offer 
customers a highly available cloud hosting solution that requires no code changes in 
their applications.”

Challenge
Founded in 1987, 8x8 Inc. transformed 
itself into one of the leading stand-
alone voice over Internet protocol 
(VoIP) phone services providers 
and a leading provider of cloud 
services offering everything from 
unified communications to managed, 
dedicated hosting. 

 In late summer of 2011, 8x8 decided to 
expand its market from its traditional 
small to medium-sized business 
customers to larger enterprise and 
government customers. One of the 
major challenges for 8x8 was ensuring 
that it could offer customers a fully 
redundant and reliable platform, 
suitable for running mission-critical 
applications in a cloud environment. 
Additionally, as a service provider, 
8x8 has hosting requirements that are 
continually changing. It was difficult 
to predict precisely what workload a 
customer would bring to the company 
at a given time. Individual storage 
workloads might require different 
drives or storage layouts to efficiently 
accommodate the data.

Solution
To accelerate deployment and expand 
the range of cloud hosting services it 
offered, 8x8 chose VCE and Vblock 
Systems. The company worked closely 
with VCE partner Kovarus—a system 
integrator that specializes in data 
center design, implementation, and 
optimization—to specify requirements. 
VCE then integrated, tested, and 
validated the Vblock Series 300 model 
GX—fully configured as required—in a 
controlled factory environment, before 
shipping the racks to 8x8’s data center.

Kovarus managed the planning and 
configuration process every step of 
the way. In addition, once the Vblock 
system was reassembled in 8x8’s 
data center, Kovarus prepared the 
infrastructure so it would be ready 
for 8x8 to use for its cloud hosting 
services. They used the VMware vCloud 
API to create needed middleware, 
and customize and deploy a variety 
of applications—from provisioning 
systems to billing.

“8x8 needed a broad base of 
experience such as in-depth VMware 
experience as well as expertise with 
converged switching infrastructures 
involving Ethernet and Fibre Channel 
and SAN storage,” Schwabecher 
explains. “The Kovarus team helped us 
build and customize all the applications 
we required. We couldn’t have done  
it without them.”

Results
virtual	data	Center	virtually	overnight

Today, 8x8 can respond within 24 
hours to customers by providing 
subscription-based, hosted virtual data 
center services on the highly available 
and reliable Vblock system. The ability 
to provision storage in real time on an 
as-needed rather than pre-allocated 
basis has proven to be a competitive 
advantage. Customers can deploy their 
existing Linux or Windows applications 
such as virtual desktop infrastructure 
(VDI) or enterprise solutions such as 
MS SQL on virtual machines running 
securely in 8x8’s data center.

“We know of no other service provider 
that offers similar subscription-based 
cloud hosting with so little lead 
time,” Schwabecher comments. “We 
anticipate that these services based 
on Vblock Systems will help us meet 
the needs of a growing number of 
businesses of all sizes for hosted 
mission-critical applications.”

Schwabecher also had similar 
observations regarding the support 
he receives from VCE. Although 8x8 
hasn’t had any major issues to date, the 
company is pleased with how service-
oriented VCE is. And 8x8 especially 
appreciates that VCE offers a single 
source of support regardless of where 
an issue may arise. That’s simply not 
the case for traditional converged 
infrastructure solutions comprised  
of components from a number of 
different vendors.

“Vblock Systems represent the 
platinum standard for tier-one business 
applications and provides businesses 
with the confidence to entrust mission-
critical applications to the cloud,” says 
Bryan Martin, chairman and CEO of 
8x8. “We view this partnership as a 
major steppingstone toward our goal of 
becoming the preferred provider for all 
types of cloud services for businesses 
across the United States.”

truly	trusted	Security

To address multi-tenant environments, 
8x8 also needed to ensure customers 
could count on trusted security, with 
no commingling of data. The Vblock 
system integrates many robust security 
features including RSA and other 
encryption technologies to safeguard 
data in motion or at rest; firewalls that 
incorporate sophisticated malware 
and intrusion detection; identity 
management and access control; and 
assured application separation.

“If you look at the design of EMC VNX 
storage arrays, which are a part of the 
Vblock 300GX platform, we have the 
ability to dedicate an entire spindle to 
a customer,” notes Schwabecher. “That 
provides added security that customers 
really welcome. In addition, VMware 
offers security features that aren’t 
available with any other hypervisor.”

Key	name	Recognition

Another important selling point 
for 8x8 is the trust its customers 
have in VCE investors. Cisco, EMC, 
VMware, and Intel are among the most 
well-respected names in compute, 
network, storage, virtualization, and 
management technologies. 

“IT project managers and executive 
decision-makers who purchase cloud 
computing services recognize the 
VCE and investor company brands 
and know the high degree of integrity 
behind them,” Schwabecher states. 
“Your job might be on the line if your 
hosted Microsoft Exchange server 
goes down. You’re going to want to 
make certain you’ve selected a hosting 
service you can count on.”

 “We know of no other 
service provider that offers 
similar subscription-based 
cloud hosting with so little 
lead time. We anticipate 
that these services on 
the	vblock	system	will	
help	us	meet	the	needs

businesses of all sizes for 
hosted mission-critical 
applications.”
