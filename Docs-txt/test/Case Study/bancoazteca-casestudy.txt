Challenge 
Banco Azteca S.A. is a leading banking institution in Latin America with 1,500 branches and 15 million customers. 
The Mexico-based bank also has operations in Brazil, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras. 
Banco Azteca is owned by Grupo Salinas, a financial services, broadcasting, telecommunications, and retail 
conglomerate with operations across Latin America. 

One of the most technologically sophisticated banks in Latin America, Banco Azteca recognized early on that 
virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) would significantly improve information security. With VDI, the bank would be 
able to move proprietary data that traditionally was stored on desktops and laptops to a secure, central location. In 
addition, VDI would reduce capital and support expenditures for PCs and laptops while providing agility for an 
increasingly mobile workforce.  

In recent years, Banco Azteca pursued several VDI projects with disappointing outcomes. Separate vendors 
handling servers, storage, virtualization, and other pieces would be involved. A lack of integration among the 
different components stalled progress.

Not giving up, the bank’s senior management asked the IT team to evaluate VDI options again. Hoping to 
accelerate the project’s progress, the bank invited two providers to participate in a competitive “bake-off” that 
required delivering a pilot deployment in only four weeks. Answering the challenge, only VCE demonstrated the 
ability to design, implement, and deploy an effective solution to meet Banco Azteca’s requirements.  

Solution 
A VCE Professional Services team selected the Vblock™ Infrastructure Platforms and VMware View for the 
project. The proof of concept included assessment, design, configuration, and implementation. 

The VCE VDI Accelerator Service was used to jumpstart the VDI deployment by delivering accelerated 
assessment, planning, and design specifically designed for the Vblock solution. The VCE-validated service 
provides specialized tool sets and experienced consultants. 

The VCE team also delivered the VCE Deployment and Implementation Service and VMware View assessment-
through-deployment activities, including an evaluation to define requirements, and creation of design and use-
case definitions with the Banco Azteca team. As the Vblock system deployment was progressing, the VMware 
View plan and design were completed to define hardware configuration and settings that addressed storage, 
network, and server specifications. 

The Banco Azteca and VCE teams then built the use-case application requirements for defining the desktop 
pools. Upon Banco Azteca’s approval of the design and configuration, the VCE team executed the VMware View 
buildout and deployed the proof-of-concept pilot to 500 end-users. The entire pilot was executed in three weeks. 

Results 
Quality Services Contribute to Success 
Banco Azteca was impressed with both the speed and quality of the VDI pilot managed by VCE. While VCE 
completed the pilot in only three weeks, the other provider proof of concept was still in progress after eight weeks. 

Raul Hidalgo, infrastructure manager at Banco Azteca, said, “At Banco Azteca, we are always looking to maintain 
our competitive edge. We only implement the solutions that will help us to be the best. VCE has helped us 
achieve that goal. We were impressed with their professionalism, deep VDI expertise, and project management 
methodology. Working with VCE Professional Services has truly been a collaborative and beneficial experience. 
The commitment, skills, and knowledge of the VCE Services team were all crucial to the success of this project. A 
job that could have taken months was achieved by VCE in three weeks.” 

Converged Infrastructure Accelerates Deployment 
The advanced VDI tools and converged architecture of the Vblock Infrastructure Platforms were also factors in the 
successful pilot. 

“The VDI pilot got off to a great start because the converged Vblock infrastructure is built around pre-tested and 
pre-integrated solutions,” explained Hidalgo. “Using their advanced VCE tools, the Services team was able to 
optimize the Vblock solution physically and logically for our desktop configuration requirements.” 

With the ability to scale to 5,000 virtual desktops, the Vblock system also provides Banco Azteca with significant 
agility. The bank plans on reaching its goal of delivering thousands of virtual desktops far more quickly than it had 
expected. 

Next Steps 
When the pilot was completed, Banco Azteca’s CIO, Juan Arevalo, remarked, “The VCE VDI solution delivered in 
a diverse environment of Wyse desktop terminals, iPads, Dell PCs, and other devices. All of us on the 
management team were impressed with the technology.”

Because of the pilot’s success, Banco Azteca has requested proposals for three additional Vblock Infrastructure 
Platforms, with two supporting operations outside of Mexico and one to support an additional 2,000 VDI seats in 
Mexico.  

“The possibilities for our Vblock solution are endless,” commented Hidalgo. “It will give us much more agility as we 
expand into new markets and offer new lines of business, since less physical infrastructure will be required.”
