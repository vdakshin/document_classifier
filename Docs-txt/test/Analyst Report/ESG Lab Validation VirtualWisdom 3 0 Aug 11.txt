ESG Lab Reports 

The goal of ESG Lab reports is to educate IT professionals about emerging technologies and products in the 
storage, data management and information security industries. ESG Lab reports are not meant to replace the 
evaluation process that should be conducted before making purchasing decisions, but rather to provide insight 
into these emerging technologies. Our objective is to go over some of the more valuable feature/functions of 
products, show how they can be used to solve real customer problems and identify any areas needing 
improvement. ESG Lab's expert third-party perspective is based on our own hands-on testing as well as on 
interviews with customers who use these products in production environments. This ESG Lab report was 
sponsored by Virtual Instruments.

Introduction  

It’s no surprise that server virtualization has had a significant impact on supporting infrastructure as IT 
organizations struggle to effectively manage, monitor, and scale resources to meet the needs of a dynamic 
environment. Getting visibility into the virtualized infrastructure remains a critical IT requirement.  This ESG Lab 
Validation examines Virtual Instrument’s VirtualWisdom product line and validates VirtualWisdom’s ability to 
provide visibility of fibre channel traffic from virtual servers to storage within an IT data center. ESG Lab completed 
testing of the VirtualWisdom product line, including its new SAN Performance Probe, in August, 2011. This excerpt 
is a preview of the full VirtualWisdom ESG Lab Validation report, which will be published in September, 2011. 

Background 

When IT organizations were asked the impact server virtualization has had on their storage infrastructure 35% 
responded that it has increased their use of SAN-based storage.1 This number will only grow as virtualization 
continues to move into the data center to support business critical applications. 

One of the benefits of virtualization is that it obscures the physical complexity of the underlying hardware from 
applications. But that abstraction complicates the causes of performance problems and outages from IT Operations, 
as multiple support teams in IT must come together (server, networking, and storage) making it difficult to diagnose 
and resolve issues.

The VirtualWisdom Solution 

Virtual Instruments delivers a unique solution, providing real-time operational, utilization, performance monitoring 
and root-cause diagnostics for the SAN. VirtualWisdom passively mirrors traffic flowing across the SAN to examine 
an out-of-band copy of the traffic, combining the results with monitoring data gathered from both VMware ESX 
servers and the SAN switches to present a comprehensive set of granular, accurate monitoring data.  

As shown in Figure 2, VirtualWisdom deploys multiple probes, both hardware and software, to collect data from 
servers to SAN. The combined data is hosted on the VirtualWisdom server and provides a central store for analysis 
and real-time monitoring of the SAN infrastructure. 

Figure 2. The Virtual Instruments VirtualWisdom Product Line 

 

VirtualWisdom provides a solution that facilitates the following key benefits: 

  Virtual infrastructure optimization–Performance metrics not only at the virtual server level, but also at the 

switch and storage array helps virtual server administrators more accurately identify where performance 
problems are occurring and provide a more intelligent plan for provisioning and load balancing applications 
deployed on virtual machines. 
SAN optimization–With a comprehensive view of SAN traffic and a historical data trail, administrators can 
quickly pinpoint the root cause of application service interruptions. This allows SAN administrators to 
determine without a doubt if the SAN is the root cause of an outage or slow application performance.   

 

  Private cloud optimization–IT organizations looking to move services to a private cloud can use the 

monitoring and reporting capabilities of VirtualWisdom to help fulfill service level agreements related to 
performance and availability and minimize the costs associated with providing the high level SLA’s required 
for cloud services.

ESG Lab Validation  

ESG Lab performed hands-on evaluation and testing of the VirtualWisdom product line at the Virtual Instruments 
headquarters in San Jose, California. Testing was designed to demonstrate the capabilities of VirtualWisdom in ease 
of implementation and management, SAN utilization and performance optimization, and real-time monitoring and 
analysis. 

SAN Utilization and Performance Optimization 

The test bed used by ESG Lab is illustrated in Figure 3. A VirtualWisdom SAN Performance Probe, Model ProbeFC8, 
is attached to a Fibre Channel Traffic Access Point (TAP) to receive out of band SAN traffic for continuous 
monitoring and reporting. The data is sent to the VirtualWisdom server every second for collection and analysis. In 
addition, SAN Availability Probe and Virtual Server Probe software are installed on the VirtualWisdom server to 
monitor the fibre channel switch fabric and virtual server environment. 

Figure 3. The ESG Lab Test Bed 

 

ESG Lab Testing 

ESG Lab tested ease of use and deployment of the VirtualWisdom software. The server software was installed in 10 
easy steps and leasing probes for monitoring SAN traffic was straightforward and simple to implement. The views 
application allowed ESG Lab to look at SCSI metric sets showing end to end data from virtual machine to SAN, along 
with a complete layout of the logical topology of the SAN infrastructure. 

Next, ESG Lab examined the dashboard application that provides a comprehensive view of performance metrics for 
the SAN environment. ESG Lab was able to configure widgets to examine multiple metrics for the SAN, switches and 
virtual machines, and set thresholds to determine where potential performance problems occurred.

ESG Lab created a custom tab in the dashboard application that examined performance of the SAN infrastructure 
from an application point of view. Using SAP as an example, ESG Lab was able to see metrics on the server such as 
average CPU utilization and memory utilization. In addition, ESG Lab measured buffer to buffer credits and 
frames/sec on the switch attached to the virtual servers. On the storage side ESG Lab saw multiple metrics from 
MB/sec on the ports to errors such as aborts and busy. 

Finally, ESG Lab tested the performance of the virtual server environment by first creating a widget to measure the 
CPU utilization of two virtual machines on two separate storage LUN’s. As shown in Figure 4, virtual server esx4-cl1a 
was exceeding the threshold for CPU utilization averaging 84.68%, while esx4-cl1b was within the acceptable limits 
of CPU utilization at 30.76%. ESG Lab used vMotion to move a virtual machine, ESX4-VMotionTestVM-XP, to 
another virtual server on another storage LUN to alleviate the high CPU utilization.   

Figure 4. Virtual Machine Overutilization 

 

 

ESG Lab examined the average CPU usage on both esx4-cl1a and esx4-cl1b and found both were now under the 
acceptable threshold of 57.23% and 30.99% respectively after a successful move of virtual image. Figure 5 shows 
the new metrics for both virtual machines.

Why This Matters  

 

When asked what areas IT organizations plan to make the most significant investments in their storage 
infrastructure 21% responded with improved storage management tools. This comes as no surprise since growth in 
virtualization and storage tend to go hand in hand. Key to the successful growth of virtualization is the ability to 
monitor and respond proactively to the demands of this dynamic environment. This can be a difficult task when 
multiple constituents in IT are required to coordinate the design and management of servers, storage and the 
network that are key support components. When performance problems arise, in can take hours or days to 
diagnose the root cause. IT organizations need the real-time visibility to see how these servers, storage and 
network switches are impacted by new applications that are provisioned into the virtual environment to minimize 
potential service interruptions. 

Virtual Instruments provides that visibility with a solution that actively monitors and reports on all traffic within the 
SAN infrastructure to easily identify the cause of service interruptions and provide IT the ability to act quickly to 
mitigate the effect of performance problems. ESG Lab found the solution easy to install and manage, and found a 
wealth of information to help measure key performance metrics and identify transmission errors and their source.
