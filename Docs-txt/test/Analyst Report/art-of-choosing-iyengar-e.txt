•  Choice defines and empowers people, although it sometimes overwhelms them.
(cid:129)  Human beings want to have choices, even from infancy. Being able to choose – and 

thus have some control in life – makes folks healthier and happier.

(cid:129)  Culture – whether it emphasizes individualism or collectivism – plays a part in your 

expectations about choice. 

(cid:129)  Religion and national culture can define values that limit individual choices.
(cid:129)  Each decision defines your identity, so having too many choices adds difficulty.
(cid:129)  Choosing is easier when the brain’s two decision-making systems – the unconscious 

“automatic” system and the conscious “reflective” system – work together.   
(cid:129)  Advertising and marketing reach deep into culture to influence your choices.
(cid:129)  Heuristics (rules of thumb), including framing, patterns, availability and confirmation 

bias, also can affect decision making.

and companies influence choices, 3) Why too many options confound consumers and 
4) How people can make better decisions.

Recommendation
Easy choices – like cake or death, as in British comedian Eddie Izzard’s famous routine – 
don’t require much thought or study. But almost any other choice invites complications and 
confusion, a problem social psychologist Sheena Iyengar mines and turns into fascinating 
reading. In this study of different facets of decision making, she delves into such topics 
as whether your devotion to Coca-Cola relies on its taste or its ties to Santa Claus, and 
she touches upon subjects as varied as fashion, rats, jam, arranged marriage, and even 
the life and death of premature babies. This compelling book (with a beautiful cover) 
answers questions about decisiveness with intriguing studies, though you may not agree 
with every conclusion. Perhaps Iyengar could have offered her suggestions for improved, 
real-life  decision  making  more  succinctly,  but  she  provides  excellent  detail,  plus  take-
home tips for making better choices in the supermarket or the boardroom. Given the fine 
job she’s done combining research with gee-whiz revelations, getAbstract suggests this 
book to managers, marketers, public relations professionals and all sales executives.

 

 

Abstract

“The ability to 
choose well is 
arguably the most 
powerful tool for 
controlling our 
environment.”

“The challenges 
we face in ﬁ nding 
our authentic self 
and choosing in 
accordance with it 
are considerable.”

Choosing Life or Death
Would you sink or swim if you found yourself adrift in the ocean? That is, could you be 
like Steven Callahan? He’s the boater who survived a capsizing accident by spending 
76 days on a raft 800 miles from the Canary Islands living on barnacles and rainwater. 
Or would you give up and die? No one can say for sure, but it’s interesting to consider 
for many reasons, including the idea of choice. That theme unites the stories of many 
survivors who define their life-and-death decisions as deliberate choices. Callahan wrote, 
“I choose to kick as long as I can.” Most people hope their survival doesn’t depend on that, 
though choices do define people.

Even rats act differently if they seem to believe it will save their lives. When psychobiology 
researchers in 1957 put rats in individual jars of water to see how long they would swim 
before drowning, rats of similar strength swam surprisingly different time spans. Some 
sank almost immediately; others swam an average of 60 hours. In a follow-up, researchers 
put the rats in the water jars, let them “wriggle free,” caged them and immersed them, 
over and over. Put in the water for the last time, the rats all swam to exhaustion, averaging 
60 hours. None gave up instantly. It seems they had learned that escape was possible, and 
they chose to live as long as they could. 

Choice covers both the capacity to control people and events, and an underlying belief in 
the possibility of such control. Being able to rule your environment gives power to self-
determination, even for babies. In one study, researchers attached strings to the arms 
of infants “as young as four months.” When they moved their arms, music played. The 
babies grew “sad and angry” when researchers removed the strings and they could no

longer make music play, though music continued sporadically. Wanting to choose comes 
naturally, though it isn’t linked to any distinct biological advantage. Without choice, as 
zoo animals show, even if someone else’s decisions set you up in luxury, you won’t be 
happy. Having a measure of control makes people happiest. A nursing home let some 
patients decide when to watch movies and which plants they wanted. After six months, 
those who had more perceived choice “were happier and more alert” and, it turned out, 
“were less likely to have died.”

Culture Dictates the Need for Choice
For 5,000 years, young women met their husbands for the first time on their wedding days, 
after their parents arranged the marriage. Many contemporary people don’t understand 
how anyone could let others handle that vital decision. Some faiths still prescribe many 
matters for their believers. Researchers expected members of these fundamentalist faiths 
to feel more hopelessness, pessimism or depression than people with more choice, but, 
instead, they show less. Depending on culture, religion and homeland, people grow up 
with varying stories about the nature of God, control and choice. Such inculcated values 
dictate how they interpret self-determination and how much choice they want. 
The  collective  way  of  life  that  dominated  world  culture  through  history  provides  a 
community  context  for  arranged  marriage.  Romantic  love  always  has  existed,  but  it 
didn’t get linked to marriage until individualism emerged in Western society. Research 
with couples in either arranged or love-based marriages shows that high “love scores” 
appear early in romantic marriage, but love diminishes over time, and lower love scores 
appear early in arranged marriages, but love increases over time. 
A culture’s “degree of individualism or collectivism” helps explain choice worldwide. 
Anglo-American  students  did  better  schoolwork  when  given  personal  choices.  Asian-
American kids did better when they thought they were doing what their mothers had 
picked out for them to do.  Western kids learn to consider their own wishes first, using 
an individualist perspective centered on personal interests, traits and preferences, from 
cereal to career choice. In collectivist cultures, kids learn to emphasize their group in 
their decisions. They identify themselves by this connectedness. They learn to prioritize 
fulfilling their parents’ wishes, not their own. Understanding different cultural narratives 
and how they affect choice should help people globally understand each other better. For 
example, in the 1980s, the Sealed Air Corporation, which makes Bubble Wrap, gave small 
teams responsibility for production at their plants. U.S.-born workers felt empowered 
and they succeeded. But the policy upset one plant’s Cambodian and Laotian immigrant 
workers, who thought their manager wasn’t doing his job properly. Only when the firm’s 
leaders introduced the new plan gradually and the workers learned that it was congruent 
with their deep belief in “collective harmony” did they find it “culturally acceptable.” 

Defining Yourself with Choice
The way that people interpret consumerism’s choices has changed with industrialization. 
Buying  was  once  very  matter-of-fact,  but  it  has  been  transformed  into  collecting 
markers of personal identity. As “an ethos of independence” took over, getting noticed 
replaced blending in, and choice became an exercise of personal definition. Now, people 
everywhere  face  utterly  new  alternatives.  Options  for  family  structure,  religion  and 
even eye color (with “tinted contact lenses”) let you express yourself in countless ways. 
Along with freedom, these decisions carry the burden of defining a person’s self-image. 
Three challenges make this hard: People believe they are more unique than they are, 
they want a consistent vision of themselves and they want it to mesh with others’ views

Santa’s suit is the 
exact same red 
as the label for 
Coke? That’s not 
a coincidence: 
The Coca-Cola 
Company holds a 
patent on the color. 
Santa is clearly a

“Perhaps the 
main issue with 
increasing choice is 
that it betrays our 
expectations.”

“We can become 
experts in the 
process of 
choosing, learning 
how to use the 
expertise of others 
to improve our 
choices and our 
knowledge of 
choice.”

“The characters in 
many of our most 
compelling and 
enduring stories 
try – and often fail 
– to resist the lure 
of the forbidden. 
Eat any fruit but 
the one on this 
tree? Love anyone 
but the son of the 
enemy? We know 
how that turns 
out.”

of them. With each potentially immobilizing choice, people define themselves privately 
and socially. The solution: Try to see your identity as ever changing, so that choosing 
helps you discover yourself.

Expecting Great Choices – and Why That Doesn’t Work
As the “marshmallow studies” of the ’60s revealed, human brains have two systems: “one 
conscious and reflective, the other unconscious and automatic.” Often, they agree. But 
in these studies, four-year-olds “battled” between the two systems. Researchers left each 
child alone with a marshmallow on a plate. The child could eat it right away, having one 
treat, but a kid who waited until the adult returned would earn two marshmallows. The 
kids waffled and worried. After about three minutes alone, most settled for one treat. 
Even adults’ automatic systems can be overwhelmed by such “temptation,” prompting 
explanations like, “I don’t know what came over me.” The 30% of kids who held out for 
two treats actually went on to be superior students and adult high-achievers. The four-year-
olds’ restraint (some fought their automatic impulses by covering their eyes or pretending 
the marshmallows were clouds) suggests that physically or mentally removing a temptation 
can strengthen self-control. Other self-discipline steps include limiting your exposure to 
forbidden items or trying to synchronize your automatic and reflective systems. 
When it comes to choosing, rules of thumb, or heuristics, usually work, but sometimes 
they lead you astray, often when they work subconsciously. Here’s how four heuristics 
function (just knowing them might improve your decision making): 
 1.  “Availability” shapes preferences, in that people recall and prefer exciting data, dramatic 

results, and the “first or last options” in a series, including a list of job candidates. 

 2.  “Framing,” the way information is posed, greatly affects how people respond to it. When 
doctors presented cancer treatment options to patients based on how many survive, 
instead of based on how many die, the patients made markedly different choices.  

 3.  “Patterns” are influential because they seem to supply order, but misreading patterns 

or connections can disrupt good decision making. 

 4.  The  “confirmation  bias,”  the  tendency  to  support  “existing  beliefs,”  leads  people 

without data to make decisions based on unsupported assumptions. 

To protect yourself from bias, either become an expert in nearly every field or study your 
choices with your reflective system. However, it isn’t so good at registering emotions, so 
using your automatic system might make you happier. Consider decisions others made 
in your situation.

Manipulating Choices?
In fashion, separating real options from industry-induced selections is difficult. Fashion 
designers unite with predictors from many industries to decide on vogue colors several 
years ahead, thus influencing your choices. Prognosticators and buyers preselect your 
available  color  palette  long  before  you  know  what  you  want.  Marketers  who  expose 
buyers to their wares with heavy media attention are using the powerful “mere exposure 
effect.” This trigger is effective because people like products and concepts more with 
increasing familiarity, though it only works if they didn’t hate them at the outset. 
Differentiating  among  products  based  on  real  variations  is  difficult.  Blind  taste  tests 
show that most wine drinkers enjoy cheap and expensive wines equally, but when they 
see the prices, expensive wines taste better to them. Some manufacturers produce a wide 
variety of nearly identical products over a range of prices, so choosing among related 
items  can  be  mind-boggling.  Consider  Coke  versus  Pepsi,  the  eternal  battle  between

choices that…have

very similar, sweet, carbonated drinks. Though they have nearly identical ingredients, 
consumers almost always claim to prefer one above the other. Coke’s marketing over time 
made it a unique brand. Ads positioned Coke – and its patented red can – behind the front 
lines in World War II, and even attached it to Santa Claus. Coke paid Swedish illustrator 
Haddon Sundblom to create ads showing Santa giving soda to kids around the world. 
That became the classic St. Nick image: a round, smiling man in a red suit with a black 
belt and boots – now an icon tied to Coke, prompting good feelings unrelated to its taste. 
Other  factors  complicate  decision  making,  such  as  familiar  signals  called  “primes,” 
which  trigger  “automatic  associations,”  and  ads  with  subtle  “subliminal  messages.” 
Listing these persuaders makes people sound like automatons, choosing at the mercy of 
forces out of their control unless they’re ever vigilant. In fact, priming and other such 
factors provide a subtle undercurrent to selection processes and barely affect your core 
beliefs. But since people dislike giving up control, they tend to overreact and idealize 
choice. Instead, worry about how these factors shape major decisions, like who to vote 
for, but not minor ones, like which drink to buy. 

When Choice Overwhelms
Executives often refer to the “jam study,” in which grocery shoppers with many jams to 
choose from bought fewer jars than shoppers with a limited selection. Now professionals 
use this information, for example, to decide how many mutual funds to offer clients. 
Although intuitively it seems that more choice might improve your quality of life, research 
shows diminishing returns for increasing alternatives after a certain point. A 1950s study 
found that from five to nine options provides the ideal range for understanding the whole 
picture. When Procter & Gamble cut its Head & Shoulders shampoo options from 26 
varieties to 15, sales increased 10%. With fewer choices, people are increasingly ready 
to decide and more pleased with their decisions.
People have a strong desire for more options, even though that doesn’t give them better 
choices. Excess options tend to make people regret and second-guess their decisions, 
perhaps because they think about all the alternatives they sacrificed by narrowing down 
to a final option. How can you navigate overwhelming options? Accept that more choice 
isn’t always good. Develop more expertise so you can make better selections. Rely on 
others’ know-how. Turn decisions into group activities or use the collective “wisdom 
of  the  crowd,”  as  with  the  Zagat  restaurant  guides  showing  consumer  ratings.  Limit 
your choices by type or group. Learn to choose better by starting with easy options and 
moving to harder ones.
Choice becomes more demanding when the stakes are bigger than jam and soda. Studies 
in the medical field reveal a fascinating look at the psyche. In one case, parents of a 
critically ill premature baby had to decide to take her off life support. They struggled 
much more with guilt and anger after she died than did parents whose doctors made that 
same decision for them. In the end, the issue may be, “What are the costs exacted by the 
choice itself?”
