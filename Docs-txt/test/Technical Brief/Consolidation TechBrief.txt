How Virtual Instruments Infrastructure Optimization Best 
Practices Accelerate Datacenter Consolidation Initiatives 
Introduction 

Data center consolidation projects are typically initiated in order to lower IT costs and improve overall IT operational 
efficiency.  The trend to consolidate data centers has been enabled by both server consolidation and storage 
consolidation.  Server consolidation is an approach to the efficient usage of computer server resources in order to 
reduce the total number of servers that an organization requires. The practice developed in response to the problem of 
server sprawl, a situation in which multiple, in some cases hundreds or thousands of, under-utilized servers take up 
more space and consume more resources than can be justified by their workload. 

Although consolidation of servers and storage can substantially increase the efficient use of resources, it may also result 
in complex configurations of data, networks, applications, and virtual servers that need to support highly unpredictable 
workloads. To alleviate this problem, server virtualization is used to mask the details of server resources from users 
while optimizing resource sharing. Another approach to server consolidation is the use of blade servers to maximize the 
efficient use of space. Yet a third is the technology refresh, where previous-generation servers are simply replaced by 
much more efficient devices. 

The changing mix of applications and evolving data management requirements is driving major change in storage 
requirements. IT managers are demanding storage solutions that allow them to deploy complementary tiers of 
networked storage systems optimized to meet specific requirements for performance, capacity, reliability, and cost.  
Consolidating older, expensive Tier 1 storage systems into newer, more cost-effective lower tiered storage is another 
strategy often employed in data center consolidation projects. 

Consolidation challenges for servers and storage infrastructure 

Growth

Troubleshooting 
challenge 

Consolidation will only mitigate some of the effects of data growth. Chronic over-provisioning of 
server capacity and storage infrastructure, partially due to uncontrolled growth, will remain a key 
issue and is not likely to be significantly affected unless other changes are made to planning and 
reporting.   

Consolidation alone will not add a reporting capability that ties infrastructure to quality of storage 
service delivered to applications.  In fact, storage- and server-consolidation initiatives traditionally 
simplify the asset layer but move complexity of storage management to server infrastructure, with 
no net difference in overall effort.  With consolidation, you increase the need to establish a 
concrete method for validating interoperability and performance on new or changed devices – 
before introduction to the production environment. 

There has long been some comfort to be found in the “physicality” and accessibility of key devices.  
Data center infrastructure consolidation will create more interdependencies between systems. For 
a given application, dependencies may cross multiple other applications, servers, SAN fabrics, IO 
adapters, and network hops. In the meantime, IT departments, for the most part, continue to be 
“siloed” and the tools to monitor and analyze problems likewise continue to provide either very 
simple views of the infrastructure, or more commonly, isolated view of components.  

Virtualization / 
private cloud 
challenge 

When problems arise, we have always been able to identify a switch port for examination, a server 
at the end of a wire that might be causing problems, an HBA for inspection, or any number of other 
physical things we can turn to for further examination.  But in a datacenter that uses virtualization 
and private cloud technologies to achieve cost reduction and speedier provisioning, that comfort 
has vanished.  

Performance / 
sizing challenge 

Accurately sizing all infrastructure components in the consolidated data center has traditionally 
been more of an art than science.  Understanding the performance and workload characteristics of 
virtualized applications is often very difficult to assess, often leading to major performance issues 
occurring at peak times due to resource contention between the resources.

Storage network 
infrastructure 
challenge 

A new, consolidated datacenter will inevitably include new network infrastructures to support the 
greater I/O demands.  While these networks are potentially beneficial from a performance 
perspective, transitioning to higher speeds creates some real challenges for SAN architects.   

How Virtual Instruments’ can help with datacenter infrastructure consolidation 

Virtual Instruments offers an Infrastructure Optimization solution that holistically assesses the entire physical, virtual, and 
private cloud infrastructure, and provides the IT staff with the data necessary to make intelligent decisions about 
capacity, utilization, and performance for every layer of the I/O infrastructure – from the host to the storage.  Our 
recommended best practices include:  

Monitoring and Measurement Best Practice 

A best practices-compliant physical layer must be capable of being both maintained and monitored in order to meet 
performance and availability demands. Physical layer maintenance requires the ability to quickly and easily add, change, 
or remove links and devices. Monitoring ensures the accuracy of the changes and validates that they produce only the 
desired results. Physical layer monitoring and measurement is the real-time acquisition and correlation of error, 
performance, and utilization data.  This is enabled via optical splitters, called Traffic Access Points, or TAPs that allow 
passive access to this real-time data, and by probe instrumentation that analyzes the fibre channel frames. Virtual 
Instrument’s SANInsight TAP Patch Panel System and VirtualWisdom SAN Performance Probe provide a range of 
options for monitoring and analyzing the I/O path from the physical or virtual host to the LUN.

Tiering Management Best Practice 

Virtual Instruments VirtualWisdom® is the missing puzzle piece of the tiering value proposition.  Drive speed is only one 
factor in achieving the desired application performance for a storage tier and is often the smallest, most expensive 
performance differentiator.  VirtualWisdom tracks I/O conversations to provide both real-time monitoring and trend 
analysis of overall performance between applications and all
switches, virtualization appliances, storage ports, and LUNs.  Combined with the storage vendor SRM tools with their 
emphasis on storage system metrics, VirtualWisdom provides the critical missing data to enable IT organizations to 
more confidently use lower cost, lower tier storage to provide higher tier performance.  Virtual Instruments adds 
application latency data and other information to properly plan and optimize the environment.  This is combined with 
alerting capabilities to prevent user impact as demands change, enabling IT to realize huge CAPEX improvements while 
delivering on SLAs.

High Availability Best Practice 

Beyond adding full I/O path awareness to let IT make more intelligent performance-based tiering decisions, 
VirtualWisdom also provides deep, physical-layer knowledge of the fabric to enable actual problem avoidance, 
accelerate troubleshooting, and help de-risk the move to a consolidated computing model.  Every network has hidden 
issues, from physical layer errors to configuration and load-balancing issues such as failed multipathing. By setting 
alerts keyed to these issues, administrators can proactively eliminate them while they are still benign, making IT 
administration a proactive activity rather than a series of firefighting drills.  

Problem Resolution Best Practice 

Decreasing time to problem resolution is accomplished by monitoring transactions from the physical or virtual host to 
the LUN with VirtualWisdom. The ability to rapidly zero in on the source of the problem, proving within minutes whether 
the SAN is to blame for slow application performance or not, focuses the right team on the task and allows other teams 
to remain focused on other strategic imperatives.  VirtualWisdom is the only product that can monitor and send an alert 
about storage access times, congestion, link errors, and SCSI errors, and generate trend reports that show the behavior 
of a heterogeneous SAN, by host and by application. This information helps to dramatically expedite troubleshooting 
and allows the IT manager to prove whether the problem is in the SAN, the application, or the server.  

Storage Network Provisioning Best Practice 

The lack of ability to actively measure SANs means storage architects design for the very worst case. In our 
engagements with customers, we have consistently found that storage networks at larger datacenters are significantly 
over-provisioned, with average network link utilization rates of less than 5%. VirtualWisdom can help consolidate 
underutilized SAN ports to postpone acquiring additional expensive core switch ports, storage ports, related cables, and 
SFPs.   

Private Cloud Best Practices 

When you look at where people historically focus on system management, it’s around capacity and utilization.  Server 
and storage virtualization now make capacity planning relatively easy, shifting the key criteria for success in private 
cloud computing to performance.  When you look at a virtualized or private cloud environment, optimizing CPU and 
memory only gets you so far.  For I/O-intensive applications such as those running OLTP databases, looking only at 
server-related metrics is simply inadequate.  I/O optimization is the key as it is the third leg of the “systems optimization 
stool”.  What administrators need is a way to see into multiple dimensions of the infrastructure, in real time. 
VirtualWisdom’s hardware monitoring is non-intrusive to the link and to the cloud component.   It sees evidence of 
degraded behavior because it sees and measures everything, not just the upper layers of the stack, and not just what a 
cloud component tells it.  

Summary  

Real-time proactive monitoring, measurement, correlation, and alerting enables high consolidation rates without 
impacting performance as demands change. It eliminates the risk associated with data center consolidation by enabling 
delivery of and adherence to SLAs.  Changes in demand and performance can now be detected long before users are 
impacted. With VirtualWisdom’s “what if” performance modeling capabilities, IT staff can provide extremely accurate 
performance forecasts by using actual historical data and applying configuration changes to that data.  Running reports 
that show latency and throughput enable the comparison and recommendation of other options that balance utilization 
and result in faster and less risky consolidation. 

The benefits of consolidation are well understood and Virtual Instruments can accelerate the initiative by providing best 
practices around server and storage consolidation with an advanced measuring, monitoring, analysis, and optimization 
solution.
