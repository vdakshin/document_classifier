 

TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS: BIG 
DATA AND ANALYTICS WITH VCE  
AND EMC 
Vision 
Big data and analytic initiatives within enterprises have been rapidly maturing from experimental efforts to 
production-ready deployments. Businesses are increasing pressures on IT to extract greater value from 
information generated by web, social media, mobile, and other untapped data sources while making it easy to 
support a larger user population and allow for greater insights from the existing environments. In planning and 
revamping analytical efforts, embracing big data projects, such as Hadoop, as part of the enterprise architecture is 
becoming a crucial part of strategic efforts to drive competitive advantage in making decisions and running 
operations. For this reason, business impetus to evolve Hadoop implementations from being reliant only on 
commodity hardware to being ready to be deployed on enterprise-class infrastructure is at an all-time high.   

In advancing from proof-of-concept environments to production-ready infrastructures, businesses are seeking to 

  Augment core business processes and decisions with big data 

  Increase virtualization, multi-tenancy, and data protection-run IT-as-a-service 

  Meet security, governance, and compliance requirements with data oversight and visibility 

  Ensure mission-critical availability and performance tuned to business needs 

  Drive standardization across data centers and ensure flexibility for logical and physical change 

  Adapt to deployment demand incrementally with a mix and match of technology components 

Formed by Cisco and EMC with investments from VMware and Intel, VCE is the leading innovator of converged 
infrastructure systems. Customers rely on VCE for the fastest deployment of infrastructure and applications, the 
highest performance and availability, and the lowest Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). EMC is a global leader in 
enabling businesses and service providers to transform their operations and deliver information technology as a 
service (ITaaS). Fundamental to this transformation is cloud computing. Through innovative products and 
services, EMC accelerates the journey to cloud computing, helping IT departments to store, manage, protect, and 
analyze their most valuable asset—information —in a more agile, trusted, and cost-efficient way. VCE and EMC 
are now helping our customers simplify, speed, and adapt their cloud deployment to drive better business

outcomes on a converged system.  Unlike traditional approaches where big data projects were confined to limited 
business units or research efforts, our approach enables organizations to drive revenues, control cost and risk, 
protect against privacy and security concerns, and meet compliance and governance mandates with their big data 
and analytics initiatives.   

Solution Overview 
The solution exploits Vblock™ System with VCE Vision™ Intelligent Operations and Vblock™ Data Protection 
with EMC’s selected portfolio of solutions for big data and analytics. Featuring Compute and Network technology 
from Cisco, Storage and Data Protection from EMC, and Server Virtualization and Virtualization Management 
from VMware, Vblock Systems are the most innovative, converged infrastructure in the industry. VCE Vision 
software discovers the physical and logical configuration of Vblock Systems, including the system definition, 
release compliance, and operations automation package; and delivers API integration with a customer’s choice of 
data center management frameworks. Uniquely designed to help organizations achieve the highest levels of 
reliability, security, availability, and performance, EMC’s comprehensive portfolio, including storage products such 
as EMC Symmetrix VMAX, VNX, and Isilon, and production products such as EMC Avamar, Data Domain, 
VPLEX, and RecoverPoint, are crucial components of Vblock Systems. For structured data in particular, 
organizations can choose Symmetrix VMAX for powerful, highly-secure operations, or VNX for the highly-
performant density needs of unified operations. For unstructured data including files, businesses can use Isilon for 
scale-out, Network Attached Storage (NAS) with native Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) integration. This 
solution is open for organizations to deploy Hadoop distributions and other analytics of preference such as SAS 
and to support traditional databases and other systems and applications as part of the analytic value chain. It also 
empowers businesses to virtualize Hadoop deployment with VMware vSphere Big Data Extension (BDE) for 
operational simplicity, better resource utilization with multi-tenancy, and enterprise-class scaling and availability.  

	  

Addressing Industry Challenges 
Organizations have recently increased their investments in big data and analytics initiatives to support corporate 
mandates to drive customer acquisitions, improve operations, reduce cost and risk, and better manage risk and 
fraud. In many cases, business owners have worked with analysts and data scientists to derive business rules to 
spot new patterns and create new offerings, derive new rules, and fine-tune algorithms to innovate new solutions 
as part of research and development. Others have built Hadoop and adjacent solutions in the commodity 
hardware that needs transitioning to the next generation infrastructure for which mission-critical availability and 
performance, interoperability with the rest of enterprise architecture, and privacy and security are mandatory. . In 
evaluating the current and future architecture, the following challenges have become clearer:

  To migrate or continue replicating data that is part of the core systems to create an integrated architecture 

is time-consuming and inefficient 

  Business demand is unpredictable and demands a service-driven approach. However creating an 

environment to quickly provision new services is harder without multi-tenancy and virtualization 

  Commodity hardware with direct attached storage (DAS) is harder to manage as an enterprise 

infrastructure due to privacy, security and security concerns, and lack of IT oversight 

  Availability and performance are becoming greater issues as aggregating a larger set of scattered data 

including social and mobile data across the enterprise is a significant undertaking  while businesses 
demand more stringent SLA end-to-end  

  Big data deployments based on commodity hardware are harder to replicate across data centers. 

Dedicated appliances, while useful for specific analytics, are harder to upgrade and to migrate technology 
components to newer generations  

  Difficulties in integrating legacy environments with new data and applications for analytic purposes 

incrementally 

Big Data and Analytics on Vblock™ Systems 
When deploying big data and analytics on Vblock Systems, businesses can enjoy the benefit of standardizing on 
the optimized infrastructures across data centers while choosing the right set of compute, network, and storage for 
the big data and analytic use cases. For example,  

  Achieve elasticity, scalability, and reliability benefits on Vblock System 300 or Vblock System 700 family 

utilizing Cisco B-series and best-in-class networks, and EMC VNX or Symmetric VMAX 

  Ensure mission-critical readiness of Hadoop deployment with EMC Isilon deployed on Vblock 300 or 

Vblock 700 family to exploit multi-tenancy, virtual / bare-metal implementation, HDFS integration, privacy, 
and reliability advantage 

  Drive operational and performance gains running high performance databases in conjunction with running 

sophisticated analytics in an integrated environment 

  Ensure faster, better business outcome by analyzing massive quantities of data and scale within the cloud  

  Ensure data protection with VCE Data Protection, including EMC Avamar, Data Domain, VPLEX, and 

RecoverPoint 

  Future proof big data and analytic deployments with ease of upgrade for Compute, Network, and Storage 

in response to demand change and availability of new technologies.
