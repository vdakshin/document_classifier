Optimizing an IBM AIX VIO Server with LPARS in a 
Fibre Channel SAN with VirtualWisdom® 

 

 

Introduction 
Virtualization is a hot topic in the computing industry, with many widely different technologies and 
solutions being recommended, developed and used. IBM POWERx-based machines have inherited 
the know-how from IBM mainframes to provide opportunities for a significant reduction in operating 
costs for complex environments.  The POWERx implementation uses advanced processor features, 
firmware (also known as Hypervisor) and hardware features to create efficient and flexible 
virtualization capabilities. These capabilities are offered from the top to the bottom of the server 
range.  The key to this virtualization is the Virtual I/O (VIO) Server. 

Virtual Instruments’ VirtualWisdom supports and enhances the use of VIO and logical partitions 
(LPARs), by offering the industry’s only real-time Fibre Channel SAN performance monitoring and 
optimization solution. 

VIO / LPAR Architecture 
pSeries servers from IBM allow a machine to be divided into LPARs, with each LPAR running a 
different OS image -- effectively a server within a server. This can be achieved by logically splitting  
a large machine into smaller units with CPU, memory, and PCI adapter slot allocations. 

The pSeries and OpenPower servers can also run an LPAR with less than one whole CPU -- 
multiple LPARs per CPU.  With each LPAR needing a minimum of one SCSI adapter for disk I/O and 
one Ethernet adapter for networking, 20 LPARs would require the server to have at least 40 PCI 
adapters. This is where the VIO Server helps.

IBM VIO Resource Sharing 
The VIO Server owns real PCI adapters (Ethernet, SCSI, or SAN), but allows other LPARs to share 
them remotely using the built-in Hypervisor services. These other LPARs are called Virtual I/O client 
partitions (VIO client). And because they don't need real physical disks or real physical Ethernet 
adapters to run, they can be created quickly and cheaply.  Each VIO client operates as if it had a 
dedicated SCSI device but in fact, each client device is a real disk partition (logical disk partition) on 
the VIO Server. The VIO Server and VIO client communicate using the pSeries Hypervisor, allowing 
disk I/O requests to be transferred between the LPARs using a message-passing protocol. 

Virtual fibre environment and VirtualWisdom 
For IBM AIX systems (AIX 5.3 TL9 or later, or AIX 6.1 TL2 or later) which support N_Port ID 
Virtualization (NPIV), SAN objects such as switches, HBAs, storage devices, or virtual machines can 
be assigned World Wide Name (WWN) identifiers. WWNs uniquely identify such objects in the Fibre 
Channel fabric and by using NPIV, a SAN administrator can monitor and route storage access on a 
per virtual machine (LPAR) basis.  A detailed solution for mapping VIO port WWN's to proper 
manufacturer and device type can be obtained from your Virtual Instruments Solutions Consultant. 

WWPNs do not move with the LPAR.  Each virtual HBA path has an active and passive WWPN, one 
residing in each physical frame.  For instance, LPAR1 on HBA1 will have WWPN X and WWPN Y.  
When the LPAR is active on Physical Frame A, WWPN X will be active and WWPN Y is disabled.  If 
the LPAR is migrated onto Physical Frame B, then WWPN Y is activated and WWPN is disabled.  
For this reason, VirtualWisdom does not need to handle WWPNs moving across switch ports. 

NPIV is typically used in high throughput, high I/O environments where VirtualWisdom is often 
deployed to ensure optimized performance. 

Virtual SCSI environment and VirtualWisdom 

Without NPIV (also referred to as Virtual Fibre, above) enabled, VirtualWisdom does not differentiate 
by LPAR, but still can differentiate by LUN.  This is also referred to as a Virtual SCSI environment.  

VirtualWisdom’s Value Add 
VirtualWisdom is an innovative solution that helps IT organizations realize the full economic benefits 
of networked storage and server virtualization, including environments running IBM’s AIX with VIO 
and LPARs.  

When used with NPIV or dedicated LUNs, VirtualWisdom and SANInsight SAN Performance 
Probe, can track individual I/Os from the LPAR through to the LUN.  With this full path 
awareness, VirtualWisdom enables:  

•  Operational (OpEx) savings through improved operations and faster troubleshooting 
•  Capital expenditure (CapEx) savings by eliminating over-provisioning and over-tiering  
•  Better adherence to, and monitoring of SLAs and external regulations  
•  Higher revenues through accelerated application and SAN deployments  
•  Stronger vendor management and improved vendor relationships  
• 
•  Accelerated use of  storage tiering 
•  Reduction in unplanned downtime

SAN Topology with pSeries and VirtualWisdom 

 
 
VirtualWisdom provides comprehensive instrumentation and measurement capabilities of the SAN and virtualized 
infrastructure that reduce application response time, accelerate storage I/O, increase availability, and improve resource and 
SAN utilization. VirtualWisdom is the only solution that can non-intrusively improve the performance of virtualized 
applications in real-time by analyzing actual SAN I/O traffic data.  

A more thorough discussion of VirtualWisdom benefits that apply to all FC SAN and virtualized environments can be found

Summary 
This information brief is meant to be an overview document and details on specific capabilities of different generation IBM 
pSeries systems and AIX releases should be obtained directly from IBM. 

Virtual Instruments’ VirtualWisdom supports the use of VIO Servers and with NPIV, offers full path monitoring from the 
LPAR to the LUN.  VirtualWisdom increases the value of the virtualized AIX-based environment through more aggressive 
use of tiered storage, faster troubleshooting, eliminating switch over-provisioning, better monitoring of SLAs, and lowering 
the risk of deploying more LPARs per server and virtualizing mission critical applications.
