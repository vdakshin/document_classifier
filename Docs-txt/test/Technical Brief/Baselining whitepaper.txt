Introduction
The primary objective of the IT department is to support the growth and smooth operation of
the business unit or of the entire organization. This implies that IT must ensure new
applications are rolled out quickly and reliably, applications are up and available to users,
and that application response times to the users are acceptable.
IT has to accomplish this with as low a budget as possible with the fewest number of people
possible; they have to be productive and efficient.  The mantra of “do more with less” can
be heard in nearly every datacenter operation around the globe.

At the same time, today’s IT infrastructure has scaled out of control, with more
interdependencies between systems, while continuously operating closer to the
performance limits of the infrastructure than ever before. For a given application,
dependencies may cross multiple other applications, servers, SAN fabrics, IO adapters,
network hops, and even datacenters. When the performance limit of a single component in
one of these systems is breached, common experience indicates these I/O laden systems
will not see performance gradually degrade, but rather will see latency and performance
rapidly spiral out of control under a bombardment of increasingly delayed, dropped and
repeated I/O attempts that can no longer be queued, cached, backed-off by congestion
controls, or otherwise gracefully handled.

Performance and availability
baselining is used by leading
enterprises to de-risk migration,
consolidation, technology
refreshes, and application
upgrade project˘s

How are administrators dealing with these challenges today? Most businesses today rely
upon their initial testing of known good configurations or arbitrary rules of thumb rather than
real data when they manage and make decisions about their infrastructures. They often
throw more hardware at “the problem”.  This makes planning an exercise in waste that over-provisions resources,
provides no guarantees that SLAs can be met, obfuscates troubleshooting, and restricts flexibility. Moreover, as
configurations change over time, administrators have no guarantees about what their current infrastructure capabilities
are.

 Without baselining, any efforts to establish SLAs is a guessing game,

which is probably the biggest reason relatively few companies
implement meaningful SLAs.

 Without baselining, the typical answer of an IT vendor to the

question “how will this deployment impact my application
performance” is “we don’t know; go ahead and try it; it should work”.

 Without baselining, it’s hard to know to what extent your deployment

of mission-critical applications in a virtualized / private cloud
infrastructure affects application performance.

 Without baselining, the next-best approach to de-risking your IT

projects is to over-provision with excess hardware.

Baselining Defined
Baselining is traditionally thought of as a method for analyzing IT infrastructure performance. The method is marked by
comparing current performance to a historical metric, or "baseline". For example, if you measured the performance of
a network switch over a period of time, you could use that performance figure as a comparative baseline if you made a
configuration change to the switch.  But if you extend that concept past performance and encompass availability, you
are baselining many other metrics.

In today’s world, the real best practice of baselining includes historical metrics that identify the health of the
infrastructure.  All environments and IT components have some degree of variation in their health that can be
measured.  For instance, in a SAN, SCSI Reservation Conflicts are a normal part of the SCSI protocol and they are not
actually errors. The SCSI protocol uses the reservation to allow exclusive access to a LUN. It does this to prevent data
corruption should there be competing devices for the same LUN.  A healthy SAN will experience SCSI Reservation
Conflicts, but in excess, they can cause poor response times, as devices must wait for access. It’s a common best
practice to baseline this metric and set alerts for out-of-bound conditions, which can often foretell application
slowdowns or even outages.

Benefits of Baselining
Business managers often make the mistake of assuming that baselining is being done, or that baselining is something
too far down in the “weeds” to care about.  If you aren’t getting meaningful “baseline” reports on infrastructure health
and performance, perhaps you should ask. Our customers have demonstrated real business benefits to this best
practice; and here are just some of them:

Mitigate the risk of moving mission-critical applications to a private cloud and virtualized infrastructure.

Cloud computing and virtualization offer many benefits, but IT staff lose the ability to “see” through the virtualized
cloud, jeopardizing their ability to troubleshoot problems and assure that performance meets application SLAs. It’s no
secret that many companies are reluctant to virtualize their most mission-critical applications, leaving 70%+ of today’s
enterprise applications still running on purely physical infrastructures. What happens when an application slows?
VirtualWisdom baselining enables you to capture the “before” performance metrics, to establish SLAs, then provide
reports to the business owners of the applications as you virtualize your infrastructure.

De-risk major datacenter consolidation and migration projects.
Major datacenter projects, such as server and storage migrations, refreshes, and consolidations all carry a risk of
unexpected problems. And new or major application refreshes add to the risk. You can experience delays and cost
overruns when performance, mis-configuration, or availability issues arise. Even with all the help you get from your
vendors, properly designing your new environments still includes guesswork. With the real-time monitoring backed by
relevant metrics provided by VirtualWisdom, you can baseline the entire infrastructure’s effect on application latency,
track it during the changes, and report on final results. You will know, to the millisecond, exactly how the changes are
impacting application users. And you can potentially save millions of dollars of CAPEX by eliminating the over-
provisioning you’re often forced into, in an effort to mitigate risks.

Improve business agility and reduce cycle time.
IT increasingly is being asked to move faster, to accommodate a more dynamic, global business environment. With
VirtualWisdom baselining, your IT staff gets the required visibility into the most important health and performance
indicators to enable them to know immediately whether a change is creating a problem.  This often lets them
remediate issues before the full production deployment goes live.

VirtualWisdom finds performance inhibitors before they bubble up to the application layer, accelerating new
deployments, consolidations and technology migrations. VirtualWisdom helps validate new technologies by providing
real-time measurements to determine the positive or negative performance impact of IT infrastructure changes.

Application assurance by avoiding application performance degradations or even downtime.

Performance problems are still most often reported by the application users, but it doesn’t have to be this way.  By
baselining infrastructure metrics, your server, network, and storage teams can detect and fix problems before they
cause application problems.  Every IT infrastructure has hidden issues, from physical layer errors to configuration and
load-balancing issues. Almost all application outages are the result of a combination of these issues. Without
baselining, IT staff often set alerts based on “best guess”, resulting in “alert SPAM”, which they have to ignore. By
setting meaningful alerts key to these issues, administrators can proactively eliminate them while they are still benign,
making administration a proactive activity rather than a series of fire-fighting drills. Being able to effectively address
potential issues before application users report problems creates a more methodical process of ensuring application
availability.

Resolve infrastructure problems faster.
Though rare, sev 1 problems can result in significant revenue loss and damage to a company’s brand image. By
baselining, your IT staff have the metrics to know where to start looking for problems.  VirtualWisdom is the only
product that can monitor and send alerts about storage access times, congestion, link errors, and SCSI errors, and
generate trend reports that show the behavior of a heterogeneous infrastructure, by physical or virtual host, and by
application. This information helps to dramatically expedite troubleshooting and allows the IT Manager to prove
whether the problem is in the SAN, the application, or the server. This simple first step speeds troubleshooting by
days, weeks, or even months. The goal is to reduce and if possible eliminate sev 1 issues, and where possible, remove
recurring issues that sap productivity of your IT operations staff.

Reduce storage costs through more aggressive use of storage tiering.
Without adequate baselining, it’s hard to know exactly what effect that tiering has on your applications. Rather than
risk an application slowdown, many enterprises simply develop conservative rules of thumb, which result in over-
spending for storage.  With VirtualWisdom baselining, IT organizations can measure, in real-time, to the millisecond,
the effect of lower cost tiers.  Combined with real-time alerting capabilities to prevent user impact as demands
change, IT can realize huge CAPEX savings. The ability to use less expensive storage can result in 40-50% cost per
terabyte savings and reduce floor space, power, and power/cooling requirements by up to 80%.

How Virtual Instruments Can Help
Virtual Instruments infrastructure optimization products and services provide comprehensive, real-time instrumentation
and measurement that allows IT managers to optimize the three IT imperatives of Cost, Risk, and Cycle Time. Our
product, called VirtualWisdom, enables you to optimize the performance, utilization, and availability of your datacenter
IT infrastructure by providing real-time SAN I/O measurement capabilities from the VM to the LUN.  By first baselining
your datacenter infrastructure, VirtualWisdom helps identify application performance bottlenecks, resulting in
significantly higher virtual and physical infrastructure performance and availability.

Global 2000 customers use VirtualWisdom to mitigate the risk of moving mission-critical applications to a virtualized or
private cloud environment; to proactively prevent application outages and performance problems; to quickly resolve
infrastructure problems; and to control storage costs by increasing use of more cost-effective components and
reducing the over-provisioning that’s so common.  As a result, we dramatically accelerate the roll-out of new
applications and infrastructure.

The diagram above is a simple representation of a VirtualWisdom deployment.  VirtualWisdom gets its data from fibre
channel switches via SNMP, from virtual servers via vCenter, and from the physical layer via an optical splitter (Tap
Patch Panel System).  This TPPS provides real-time, bit-for-bit copy of all traffic, unlike switch mirror or SPAN ports.
The SAN Performance Probe analyzes every transaction in real-time to provide dozens of critical statistics about
storage traffic, transmission errors, and read and write latency.

Baselining Best Practices
As noted earlier, the benefits of baselining are many.  Depending on the customer’s objective, there are several
options for conducting baselines.  Some of these are discussed in this section.  Note that these projects can and often
are combined into
a single baselining project.

Baseline #1:  Operational Assessment - Monitoring and Measurement Best Practice
Virtual Instruments commonly suggests a baseline operational assessment of the host to LUN infrastructure, to:

Establish metric values and configuration policies for managing normal, organic growth


 Minimize the risk of infrastructure-related application outages and performance degradation that impacts the



business
Drive down the number of day-to-day problems that the IT team have to deal with and improve the overall
operational efficiency of administrators

A typical 15 – 30 day operational sequence of this assessment looks something like:

1.

Install TAPs (optical splitters) into environment to enable real-time monitoring
and measurement

Whitepaper

2. Deploy and use VirtualWisdom hardware and software probes

to assess the environment

3. Review results and remediate and outstanding issues
4. Set appropriate thresholds and alerts
5.

Integrate into an OSS framework (ticketing system)

The scope of this baseline assessment usually includes monitoring and measurement of:

 Configuration – Server HBA Multipath Verification
 Configuration – Storage Port Multipath Verification
 Configuration – Missing or Incorrect Nicknames
 Configuration – Queue Depths
 Connectivity and Errors – Physical Layer Errors
 Connectivity and Errors – Failed Communication and Transactions
 Connectivity and Errors – Class 3 Discards

As an example of item #1, server/HBA multipath verification, we often find that there are substantial performance and
outage risks in existing infrastructures.  The following pie chart is a high level, summary example of a baseline
multipathing report at a large healthcare provider.

Similar issues are discovered and reported for items 2 – 8.

Baseline #2:  Storage Network Provisioning Best Practice
The lack of ability to actively measure SANs means storage architects design for the very
worst case. In our engagements with customers, we have consistently found that storage
networks at larger datacenters are significantly over-provisioned, with average network link
utilization rates of less than 5%. VirtualWisdom can help reclaim underutilized SAN ports to
postpone acquiring additional expensive core switch ports, storage ports, related cables,
and SFPs.  To baseline #1: Operational Assessment, an eighth metric is added: Capacity
Planning – HBA and Storage Port Utilization.

The baseline deployment methodology and timeline remains the same; but additional
reports and recommendations are generated aimed at right-sizing several infrastructure
components.

The sample report at the right shows the percent utilization of the most used storage ports
over a period of time.  In this case, average utilization is far less than 10%, showing an
opportunity to consolidate workloads, or perhaps defer the addition of more ports.

Baseline #3: Tiering Management Assessment Best Practice
VirtualWisdom is the missing puzzle piece of the tiering value proposition.  Drive speed is
only one factor in achieving the desired application performance for a storage tier and is
often the smallest, most expensive performance differentiator.  VirtualWisdom tracks I/O
conversations to provide both real-time monitoring and trend analysis of overall
performance between applications and all components of the Fibre Channel SAN – the
host HBA, switches, virtualization appliances, storage ports, and LUNs.  Combined with the storage vendor tools with
their emphasis on storage system metrics, VirtualWisdom provides the critical missing data to enable IT organizations
to more confidently use lower cost storage to provide higher tier performance.  Virtual Instruments adds application
latency data and other information to properly plan and optimize the environment.  This is combined with alerting
capabilities to prevent user impact as demands change, enabling IT to realize huge CAPEX improvements while
delivering on SLAs.

To baselines #1 and #2: a ninth metric is added: Performance - Exchange Completion Time

Exchange Completion Time (ECT) is a unique-to-VirtualWisdom metric that measures, to the millisecond, in real-time,
the effect of any changes in the SAN, such as moving LUNs to lower-cost tiers.

The operational sequence looks like this:

1. From baseline #1 … install TAPs (optical splitters) into environment to enable real-time monitoring and

measurement

2. Deploy and use VirtualWisdom hardware and software probes to assess the environment, adding ECT
3. Review results and recommendations
4. Set appropriate thresholds and alerts per application
5. As LUNs are moved to lower cost tiers, examine real-time dashboards for changes in ECT, compare to baseline

Baseline #4: Application Assurance Best Practice
When you look at how people historically focus on application assurance, it’s around what happens from the
application host to the client.  To see the complete picture, it’s a best practice to add in infrastructure from the host to
the data storage.  We call this “Infrastructure Performance Management”.

Infrastructure Performance Management (IPM) is a new approach to managing the performance of the physical and
virtual hardware and software resources that comprise virtualized and cloud-based computing environments. IPM
provides a response time or latency based perspective on infrastructure performance, which can be tied back to the
application. This new approach is based on a new performance metric for the infrastructure: Infrastructure Response
Time.

Infrastructure Response Time (IRT) is defined as the time it takes for any workload (application) to place a request for
work on the virtual environment and for the virtual environment to complete the request. Another way to think of IRT is
that it is an end-to-end measurement of infrastructure latency.  With it, you can improve your application assurance.

The baselining methodology builds on previous best practices.  Here, you:

Identify/Highlight areas of risk in those assets
Identify a  set of reports and target thresholds around health, availability, and performance metrics (such as ECT)
Provide application level analysis of baseline to actual results

 Create inventory map of infrastructure assets supporting a critical application



 Continue to update baselines as application workloads change


Pinpoint other application targets, including the backup or replication infrastructures

Our customers have found that by baselining for application assurance, they achieve the availability and performance
required, often with less infrastructure purchased and better guidance to the design teams.

Baseline #5:  Private Cloud Best Practice
When you look at where people historically focus on system management, it’s around capacity and utilization.  Server
and storage virtualization now make capacity planning relatively easy, shifting the key criteria for success in Cloud
Computing to performance.  When you look at a virtualized or private cloud environment, optimizing CPU and memory
only gets you so far.  For I/O-intensive applications such as those running OLTP databases, looking only at server-

related metrics is simply inadequate.  I/O optimization is the key as it is the third leg of
the “systems optimization stool”.

What administrators need is a way to see into multiple dimensions of the
infrastructure, in real time. VirtualWisdom’s hardware monitoring is non-intrusive to
the link and to the cloud component.   It sees evidence of degraded behavior because
it sees and measures everything, not just the upper layers of the stack, and not just
what a cloud component tells it.

Proper network capacity planning can help maintain datacenter infrastructures in
optimal working order, reduce risk of outages due to resource limitations, and justify
future needs.  Just like traffic reports for a city’s roadway infrastructure, the
information can be used to make both short-term and long-term decisions.  It is
important to apply baselines for patterns that occur at various times of day, week, or
even month; they are often the equivalent of “rush hour” time periods where the traffic
will be slowed due to periods of significantly increased demand.

It is a good idea to examine these time periods for workloads that can be shifted to
other ‘less busy’ times of day.  Virtual Instruments looks for activities such as batch
processing or backups that could be moved to other less busy time periods.  It is also
very common that certain regular activities have been scheduled that are not
necessary.  For example, a report that is no longer used but is configured to run
periodically.  Simply turning off the report may yield performance improvements for all
of the applications that share the same resources.  There may also be other medium-
term capacity planning activities, such as refining traffic routing to eliminate
bottlenecks and take advantage of underutilized links or storage ports.  Longer-term
planning should verify which portions of the network designs and configurations have
worked best for the specific environment and demands.  For this activity it is
important to compare the capacity, performance and configurations.

No new metrics, baselining methodology or time is added to the previously outlined
baseline assessment project to enjoy the benefits of this Best Practice.

Customer Case Study
In early 2012, a large eCommerce
company migrated a production
datacenter 400 miles, and
consolidated two major Oracle
applications from two storage
arrays to one. For the datacenter
migration, the customer (1)
baselined the application
performance at the old datacenter,
(2) tracked the latency metrics
during the migration, and (3)
provided assurance once the
migration / consolidation was
complete that there was no
negative effect on application
performance.  Additionally, the
customer used VirtualWisdom to
instrument and analyze the new
SAN, remediating several physical
and configuration problems before
the production applications went
live.  The entire project completed
on time, and thanks to the
VirtualWisdom baselining and
monitoring against that baseline, a
potentially devastating
performance issue was caught and
fixed before the heaviest
production load occurred.

Baseline #6:  Problem Resolution Best Practice
Decreasing time to problem resolution is accomplished by monitoring transactions
from the physical or virtual host to the LUN with VirtualWisdom. The ability to rapidly
zero in on the source of the problem, proving within minutes whether the SAN is to
blame for slow application performance or not, focuses the right team on the task and
allows other teams to remain focused on other mission imperatives.  VirtualWisdom is
the only product that can monitor and send an alert about storage access times, congestion, link errors, and SCSI
errors, and generate trend reports that show the behavior of a heterogeneous infrastructure, by host and by
application. This information helps to dramatically expedite troubleshooting and allows the IT Manager to prove
whether the problem is in the SAN, the application, or the server.

No new metrics, baselining methodology or time is added to the previously outlined baseline assessment project to
enjoy the benefits of this Best Practice.

Baseline #7:  High Availability Best Practice
Beyond adding full I/O path awareness to let IT make more intelligent performance-based tiering decisions,
VirtualWisdom also provides deep, physical-layer knowledge of the fabric to enable actual problem avoidance,

accelerate troubleshooting, and help de-risk the move to a consolidated computing model.  Every network has hidden
issues, from physical layer errors to configuration and load-balancing issues such as failed multipathing. By setting
alerts keyed to these issues, administrators can proactively eliminate them while they are still benign, making IT
administration a proactive activity rather than a series of firefighting drills.

No new metrics, baselining methodology or time is added to the previously outlined baseline assessment project to
enjoy the benefits of this Best Practice.

Infrastructure Maturity Model

The Infrastructure Maturity Model (IMM) is a management framework designed to systematically improve infrastructure
business value through the continuous improvement of people, processes, and technology. The objectives of the
framework are to:

 Minimize the risk of infrastructure-related application outages and performance degradation that impacts the



business
Drive down the number of day-to-day problems that the IT team have to deal with and improve the overall
operational efficiency of administrators

 Make better use of the overall capacity of the infrastructure by ensuring the I/O workload is balanced and that I/O



performance does not constrain the adoption and efficiency of the virtual infrastructure
Facilitate the use of SLAs and provide the fundamental metrics that are needed to design, deploy and manage a
flexible and scalable infrastructure that aligns with the needs of the business in the most cost-effective way.

The IMM describes five levels of infrastructure maturity, from an “unmanaged and chaotic” environment to an
optimized environment that includes both OPEX and CAPEX are optimized to meet business objectives.  Basic to this
model is the requirement that all relevant metrics are baselined.  Baselining is the only quantitative way to measure
your progress against these Best Practice standards.

Summary
Through the utilization of baselining best practices, Virtual Instruments customers realize these business benefits:
 Mitigation of the risk of moving mission-critical applications to a private cloud and virtualized infrastructure.


